# Security Policy

At RubixKube, we take security seriously. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and community members who help us maintain the security and integrity of our platform.

## üîí Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities directly to our security team using one of the following methods:

### Primary Contact
- **Email**: [security@rubixkube.ai](mailto:security@rubixkube.ai)
- **PGP Key**: Available on request for encrypted communications
- **Response Time**: We aim to acknowledge security reports within 24 hours

### Alternative Contacts
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/rubixkube-io/rubixkube/security/advisories/new)
- **HackerOne**: We may establish a bug bounty program in the future

## üìã What to Include in Your Report

To help us investigate and respond quickly, please include the following information in your security report:

### Required Information
- **Vulnerability Type**: (e.g., XSS, SQL Injection, Authentication Bypass)
- **Affected Component**: (e.g., API, Dashboard, Agent, etc.)
- **Severity Assessment**: (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions of RubixKube are impacted

### Technical Details
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear, step-by-step instructions
- **Proof of Concept**: Code or commands that demonstrate the issue
- **Expected vs Actual Behavior**: What should happen vs. what actually happens
- **Environment Details**: OS, Kubernetes version, RubixKube version, etc.

### Supporting Evidence
- **Screenshots**: If applicable and helpful
- **Error Messages**: Full error logs and stack traces
- **Network Traffic**: Relevant HTTP requests/responses
- **Configuration**: Any special configuration that may be relevant

## üîÑ Our Response Process

### Acknowledgment
- We will acknowledge your report within **24 hours**
- We will assign a primary point of contact for follow-up questions
- We may request additional information if needed

### Investigation
- Our security team will investigate the reported vulnerability
- We may reach out for clarification or additional details
- Investigation typically takes **1-7 days** depending on complexity

### Resolution Timeline
- **Critical/High Severity**: Initial fix within **7 days**, full resolution within **30 days**
- **Medium Severity**: Initial fix within **30 days**, full resolution within **90 days**
- **Low Severity**: Addressed in regular release cycle

### Communication
- We will keep you updated on our progress
- You will be notified when the vulnerability is fixed
- You may be credited in our security acknowledgments (with permission)

## üì¢ Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Responsible Disclosure
We believe in **responsible disclosure** and ask that you:

1. **Do not exploit** the vulnerability for malicious purposes
2. **Do not disclose** the vulnerability publicly until we have addressed it
3. **Give us reasonable time** to investigate and fix the issue
4. **Test on non-production systems** only

### Public Disclosure
- We will coordinate public disclosure with you
- Security fixes are typically released as part of our regular update cycle
- We may publish security advisories on our [security page](https://rubixkube.ai/security)

### Safe Harbor
We consider security research conducted in accordance with this policy to be:
- **Authorized** in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- **Exempt** from our Terms of Service prohibition against reverse engineering
- **Protected** under our commitment not to pursue legal action

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations for Users

### Best Practices
- **Keep RubixKube updated** to the latest version
- **Use strong authentication** methods
- **Follow the principle of least privilege** for API keys and access tokens
- **Regularly rotate credentials** and API keys
- **Monitor your deployments** for unusual activity

### Security Features
- **Encrypted Communication**: All API communications use TLS 1.3
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access control (RBAC) for platform features
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security-relevant events
- **Automated Updates**: Security patches are automatically applied where possible

## üìã Vulnerability Severity Guidelines

We use the following severity guidelines to prioritize security issues:

| Severity | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, complete data breach, full system compromise | RCE, SQL injection leading to data exfiltration |
| **High** | Significant data exposure, privilege escalation, authentication bypass | Token theft, unauthorized data access |
| **Medium** | Limited data exposure, denial of service, information disclosure | DoS affecting single user, limited info leak |
| **Low** | Minor issues, best practice violations, cosmetic problems | Missing security headers, typos in security docs |

## üéØ Scope

This security policy applies to:
- **RubixKube Platform**: Core application and services
- **Documentation**: Security-related documentation issues
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud infrastructure and deployment configurations
- **Dependencies**: Third-party libraries and dependencies we maintain

**Out of Scope:**
- Issues in third-party services (report to respective vendors)
- Social engineering or physical security
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
