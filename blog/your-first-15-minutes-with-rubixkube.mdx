# Your First 15 Minutes with RubixKube

Welcome to RubixKube! Whether you're evaluating Site Reliability Intelligence for your team or just curious about AI-powered infrastructure monitoring, this guide will get you up and running in 15 minutes.

---

## What is RubixKube?

RubixKube transforms how you manage Kubernetes infrastructure by adding an intelligent layer that:

- **Detects issues automatically** - No more manual kubectl checks every morning
- **Analyzes root causes** - Understand WHY things failed, not just WHAT failed
- **Provides fix guidance** - Get specific remediation steps from AI
- **Learns from incidents** - Builds knowledge to prevent future issues
- **Offers conversational access** - Ask questions in natural language via Chat

**Think of it as:** An expert SRE teammate that never sleeps, monitoring your cluster 24/7.

---

## Your 15-Minute Journey

### Minute 1-3: Sign Up

**Start here:** [Create your RubixKube account](https://console.rubixkube.ai/signup)

You'll need:
- Email address
- Google/GitHub account (for SSO)

**What you get:**
- Free Beta access
- Personal workspace
- API key for cluster connection

**Documentation:** [Sign Up Guide](/getting-started/sign-up)

---

### Minute 4-8: Connect Your First Cluster

**Two options:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Local KIND Cluster (Recommended for Testing)">
    **If you don't have Kubernetes yet:**
    
    Follow our [KIND Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation-kind)
    
    **What you'll do:**
    1. Install KIND (1 command)
    2. Create local cluster (1 command)
    3. Install RubixKube observer (1 command)
    4. Verify connection
    
    **Time:** 5 minutes
    
    **Perfect for:** Testing, learning, development
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Cloud Cluster (AWS, GCP, Azure)">
    **If you have existing Kubernetes:**
    
    Follow our [Cloud Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation-cloud)
    
    **What you'll do:**
    1. Copy your unique kubectl command from RubixKube console
    2. Run it on your cluster
    3. Verify observer pod is running
    
    **Time:** 2 minutes
    
    **Perfect for:** Staging, pre-production environments
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Important:** Do NOT install on production during Beta. Use dev/staging only.

**Checkpoint:** You should see your cluster appear in the [Clusters page](https://console.rubixkube.ai/clusters)

---

### Minute 9-11: Explore the Dashboard

**Go to:** [Dashboard](https://console.rubixkube.ai/dashboard)

**What you'll see:**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="System Health">
    Should show 100% if cluster is healthy
    
    **What it means:** Overall infrastructure status
  </Card>

  <Card title="Active Insights">
    Shows number of issues detected
    
    **What to do:** Click the number to see details
  </Card>

  <Card title="Agents">
    Should show "3/3 Active" or similar
    
    **What it means:** AI agents are operational
  </Card>

  <Card title="Infrastructure">
    Shows nodes, pods, deployments, services
    
    **What to do:** Click "View page" for topology
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Documentation:** [Using the Dashboard](/using/dashboard)

**Pro tip:** Bookmark the Dashboard - this is your daily starting point.

---

### Minute 12-14: Try the Chat Interface

**Go to:** [Chat](https://console.rubixkube.ai/chat)

**Type your first query:**
```
"What's in my cluster?"
```

**What happens:**
- SRI Agent analyzes your cluster
- Provides summary of namespaces, pods, services
- Shows you around

**Try these next:**
```
"Are there any issues?"
"Show me pod status"
"What's my cluster health?"
```

**Documentation:** [Chat Basics Tutorial](/tutorials/chat-basics)

**Why this matters:** Chat is the fastest way to interact with your infrastructure - no kubectl commands needed.

---

### Minute 15: Deploy a Test Pod (Optional)

**Want to see RubixKube detect something?**

Create a pod that will fail:

```bash
kubectl create namespace demo
kubectl run broken-demo --image=nonexistent-image:v1.0 -n demo
```

**What happens:**
1. Pod tries to start
2. ImagePullBackOff error occurs
3. RubixKube Observer detects it (within 60 seconds)
4. Appears in Dashboard Activity Feed
5. RCA Pipeline generates analysis
6. You get detailed report in Insights

**See it in action:** [Detecting ImagePullBackOff Tutorial](/tutorials/break-pod-image-error)

2. Pod logs look healthy: `kubectl logs -f [pod-name] -n rubixkube-system`
3. Network connectivity from cluster to console.rubixkube.ai
4. API key is correct (copy fresh from Clusters page)

**Wait time:** Can take 1-2 minutes for first connection

**If still failing:** Email support@rubixkube.ai with pod logs

---

### Agents Showing Offline?

**Check:**
1. Go to Agents page
2. Identify which agent
3. Verify observer pod is running
4. Check pod logs for errors

**Common cause:** Network connectivity issues

**Fix:** Restart observer pod

---

### Dashboard Shows "Initializing..."?
