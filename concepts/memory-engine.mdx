# Memory Engine: Your Infrastructure's Long-Term Memory

The**Memory Engine**is RubixKube's knowledge system that captures, stores, and learns from every incident, configuration change, and remediation action. It's the reason RubixKube gets smarter over time instead of repeating the same mistakes.

<Info>
**The Problem It Solves:**When your best SRE leaves the company, years of tribal knowledge walks out the door. The Memory Engine ensures**nothing is ever forgotten**.
</Info>

<Note>
### Beta Release - Learning in Progress
The Memory Engine is**active and learning**in RubixKube Beta:

**Available NOW:**-  Incident capture and storage
-  RCA report generation and history
-  Pattern recognition
-  Knowledge graph construction
-  Context-aware retrieval for manual decisions

**Enhanced in Future Releases:**-  Automatic remediation based on memory (currently: suggestions only)
-  Proactive prevention automation (currently: alerts and recommendations)
-  Cross-cluster learning
-  Memory-driven auto-tuning

Your Memory Engine is building knowledge NOW that will power autonomous features when released.
</Note>

## What is the Memory Engine?

Think of the Memory Engine as your infrastructure's**collective memory**- it remembers:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What Happened" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Complete timeline of every incident, deployment, configuration change
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Why It Happened" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    Root causes, contributing factors, dependency chains
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="How It Was Fixed" icon="wrench">
    Remediation steps that worked (and those that didn't)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="What We Learned" icon="lightbulb">
    Patterns, correlations, and insights extracted from experience
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

### 1. Continuous Capture

Every significant event is captured automatically:

```yaml
Incident Event:
  timestamp: 2025-10-03T14:23:15Z
  type: pod_crash
  resource: checkout-service-7f9d
  reason: OOMKilled
  
  context:
    - memory_limit: 512Mi
    - memory_usage_at_crash: 487Mi
    - uptime: 4h 12m
    - recent_deploy: v2.3.1 (2h ago)
    - traffic_spike: +40% at 14:15
    
  related_events:
    - deploy_event: v2.3.1
    - metric_anomaly: memory_growth_rate
    - code_change: payload_size_increase
```

<Accordion title="What gets captured?">
**Metadata:**- Resource details (pod, deployment, service names)
  - Timestamps (when it happened, how long it lasted)
  - Status changes (states before/during/after)
  
**Context:**- Logs (relevant excerpts, not full dumps)
  - Metrics (CPU, memory, network at time of incident)
  - Events (Kubernetes events, deployment history)
  - Configuration (resource limits, env vars, labels)
  
**Relationships:**- Dependencies (what depends on what)
  - Correlations (concurrent anomalies)
  - Causation (what caused what)
  
**Privacy Note:**Application data and business logic are NEVER stored.
</Accordion>

### 2. Knowledge Graph Construction

The Memory Engine builds a**knowledge graph**connecting concepts:

```
[OOMKilled] ----causes----> [Pod Crash]
     |
     |----occurs_when----> [Memory > 95% of limit]
     |
     |----correlates_with----> [Traffic Spike]
     |
     |----fixed_by----> [Increase Memory Limit]
     |                          |
     |                          |----typical_increase----> [512Mi → 1Gi]
     |                          |----success_rate----> [94%]
     |
     |----prevented_by----> [HPA Configuration]
                                  |----scales_at----> [80% memory]
```

This graph grows richer over time.

### 3. Pattern Recognition

The Memory Engine identifies recurring patterns:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Temporal Patterns">
### "This happens every Monday at 9am"
    - Traffic spikes at specific times
    - Batch jobs causing resource contention
    - Deployment windows correlating with incidents
    
**Action:**Proactive scaling or resource allocation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Causal Patterns">
### "When X happens, Y follows 80% of the time"
    - Database connection pool exhaustion → API timeouts
    - Config map changes → Pod restart loops
    - Version upgrades → Memory leaks
    
**Action:**Predict Y before it happens, prepare mitigation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Success Patterns">
### "This fix works 95% of the time for this issue"
    - Proven remediations for common failures
    - Optimal resource sizing for workload types
    - Effective rollback strategies
    
**Action:**Apply proven fixes confidently
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Failure Patterns">
### "This approach made things worse"
    - Changes that caused cascading failures
    - Remediations that didn't work
    - Configurations that led to instability
    
**Action:**Avoid known-bad approaches
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 4. Context-Aware Retrieval

When a new incident occurs, Memory Engine:

1.**Compares**current situation to historical incidents
2.**Ranks**by similarity (matching symptoms, environment, timing)
3.**Retrieves**relevant past RCAs and fixes
4.**Suggests**proven solutions from memory

**Speed:**< 500ms from incident detection to memory recall

## Memory-Powered Features

### 1. Intelligent RCA

Memory Engine makes Root Cause Analysis**context-aware**:

**Without Memory:**> "Pod crashed due to OOMKilled. Increase memory."

**With Memory:**> "Pod crashed due to OOMKilled. This is the 3rd occurrence this month, all after v2.x deployments. Previous fixes (512Mi→1Gi) resolved similar incidents in an average of 45 seconds with 100% success rate. Root cause likely: payload size increase in v2.3.1 (deployed 2h ago). Recommend: Increase memory to 1Gi AND investigate memory leak in v2.3.1."

See the difference?**Context transforms diagnosis.**
### 2. Proactive Prevention

Memory enables**prediction before problems**:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Deployment Risk Scoring">
    Before deploying v2.4.0, Memory Engine checks:
    
    - **Similar versions:**v2.3.x had 40% incident rate
    - **Change size:**Large payload changes previously caused OOM
    - **Dependencies:**Database schema migration required (high risk)
    
**Risk Score: 7/10 (High)****Recommendation:**Deploy to canary first, watch memory metrics
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Capacity Forecasting">
    Memory tracks trends:
    
    - Database connections grow 10% monthly
    - Current pool: 100 connections
    - Usage trending to 95% in 3 weeks
    
**Alert:**"Increase connection pool before hitting limits"  
**Timing:**Proactive, not reactive
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Configuration Drift Detection">
    Memory knows the "golden state":
    
    - Production config changed: HPA min replicas 3 → 1
    - Historical data: Single replica led to 2 incidents
    - Pattern: Low replica count = higher failure rate
    
**Alert:**"Configuration drift detected - increased incident risk"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### 3. Faster Resolution

### Learning from Success:
| Incident Type | First Occurrence | After 10 Similar | After 50 Similar |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| OOMKilled | 15min (investigation) | 2min (memory recall) | 30sec (auto-fix) |
| ImagePullBackOff | 10min (manual) | 1min (pattern match) | 15sec (auto-fix) |
| CrashLoopBackOff | 25min (debugging) | 5min (context from memory) | 2min (known fix) |

### Memory accelerates everything.

## Privacy & Data Retention

### What's NOT Stored

<Warning>
The Memory Engine is designed with**privacy-first**principles:

**Never Stored:**- Application logs containing business data
- Secrets, passwords, API keys
- Customer PII or sensitive information
- Code or container contents
- Environment variables with secrets

**Only Stored:**- Kubernetes metadata (pod names, namespaces)
- Resource metrics (CPU, memory, network)
- Event data (pod crashed, deployment updated)
- Configuration changes (resource limits changed)
- Incident timelines (what happened when)
</Warning>

### Retention Policy

| Data Type | Retention Period | Purpose |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
|**Hot Memory**| 30 days | Fast pattern matching |
|**Warm Memory**| 90 days | Trend analysis |
|**Cold Memory**| 1 year | Long-term patterns |
|**Archived**| 2 years | Compliance and deep analysis |

After retention expires, data is automatically purged.

## Memory Engine in Action

### Example: Preventing a Friday Outage

### Thursday 3pm:
```
Memory Engine: "Analyzing deployment pipeline..."

Pattern detected:
- Deployments on Friday afternoon: 12 total
- Incidents within 4 hours: 5 (42% failure rate)
- Monday-Thursday deployments: 48 total  
- Incidents within 4 hours: 2 (4% failure rate)

Insight: Friday deployments 10x riskier

Recommendation: Postpone v3.1.0 deployment to Monday
              OR: Deploy to canary environment first
              OR: Ensure full SRE coverage on-call

Risk saved: High probability of weekend incident
```

This is**institutional knowledge**in action.

## Interfacing with Memory

### Query the Memory Engine

You can ask the Memory Engine questions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Via Chat">
    ```
    You: "Have we seen this error before?"
    
    SRI Agent: "Yes, this 'connection refused' error occurred 
    3 times in the last month:
    
    1. Sept 15: Fixed by restarting redis-master (2min)
    2. Sept 22: Fixed by scaling redis replicas (5min)
    3. Sept 29: Fixed by increasing redis memory (3min)
    
    All occurred during high traffic (>1000 req/s).
    
    Suggest: Scale redis replicas preemptively during traffic spikes."
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Via Dashboard">
    Navigate to**Insights → Historical Analysis**
    - Search by error message
    - Filter by timeframe
    - Group by root cause
    - See remediation success rates
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Via API">
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
      https://api.rubixkube.ai/v2/memory/search \
      -d '{"query": "OOMKilled", "limit": 10}'
    ```
    
    Returns: Similar incidents with context
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Advanced Memory Features

### Cross-Cluster Learning (Coming Soon)

### Shared Intelligence Across Your Organization:
- Incident in `prod-us-east` → Learned by `prod-eu-west`
- Fix discovered in one cluster → Available to all clusters
- Patterns recognized faster with more data
- Best practices propagate automatically

**Privacy:**Only anonymized patterns are shared, never sensitive data.

### Memory-Driven Automation

### Auto-Tuning Based on History:
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Intelligent Auto-Scaling">
    Memory learns optimal scaling parameters:
    
    - Traffic pattern: Spike at 9am daily
    - Historical response: Manual scale-up at 8:55am
    - Memory action: Auto-scale at 8:50am preemptively
    
**Result:**Zero impact from predictable load
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Self-Optimizing Resource Limits">
    Memory tracks actual usage vs limits:
    
    - Pod never uses >400Mi but limit is 1Gi (wasted)
    - OR: Pod frequently hits limit and gets OOMKilled
    
**Suggestion:**Right-size based on 95th percentile usage + 20% buffer
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Predictive Alerting">
    Memory recognizes leading indicators:
    
    - Pattern: API latency >200ms precedes crash 90% of time
    - Current: Latency at 180ms and rising
    
**Alert:**"Potential crash in ~15 minutes. Remediate now?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: The Mysterious 2am Crash

### Initial Incident (Week 1):
```
2:15 AM: API gateway crashes
Investigation: 45 minutes
Root cause: Database connection pool exhaustion
Fix: Increase pool size 50 → 100
Memory stored: 
```

### Second Occurrence (Week 3):
```
2:12 AM: API gateway showing high latency
Memory Engine: "Pattern match! Similar to Oct 3 incident"
Alert: "Database pool usage at 92% - crash imminent"
Auto-fix proposed: Scale pool to 150 (based on current load)
Result: Incident prevented
Time: 90 seconds from detection to fix
```

**No 2am wake-up call.**Memory saved the day (and the night).

### Example 2: The Learning Curve

**Month 1:**OOMKilled incident
- Manual investigation: 20 minutes
- Fix applied: Increase memory
- Memory stores: Symptoms, cause, fix

**Month 2:**Similar OOMKilled
- Memory recalls: Previous incident 
- Suggests fix: Increase memory (90% confidence)
- SRE reviews and approves: 2 minutes

**Month 3:**Third OOMKilled
- Memory recognizes: Known pattern
- Auto-applies fix: Memory increased
- Verifies success: Monitoring metrics
- Total time: 30 seconds
- Human involvement: None (reviewed in morning)

### This is learning in action.

## Memory Health and Maintenance

### Ensuring Memory Quality

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is memory accuracy maintained?">
### Quality Control Mechanisms:
    1.**Human Feedback Loop**- SREs can mark incidents as "not helpful"
    2.**Success Verification**- Track if suggested fixes actually worked
    3.**Confidence Scoring**- Low-confidence memories flagged for review
    4.**Automatic Pruning**- Obsolete patterns removed (e.g., after major architecture changes)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete bad memories?">
**Yes!**Memory management tools allow you to:
    
    - Archive specific incidents
    - Mark patterns as "ignore"
    - Reset memory for specific services/namespaces
    - Export memory for migration
    
    Access:**Settings → System → Memory Management**</Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much storage does memory use?">
### Surprisingly little:
    - Average incident: ~50KB (metadata + context)
    - 1000 incidents: ~50MB
    - Patterns/graphs: ~100MB
    
**Total after 1 year:**Typically less than 500MB

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does memory work across different clusters?">
**Currently:**Each cluster has its own memory (isolated).
    
**Coming Soon (Q1 2026):**Cross-cluster learning where:
    - Patterns from prod inform staging
    - Multi-cluster deployments share knowledge
    - Organization-wide best practices emerge
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if my infrastructure changes dramatically?">
### Memory adapts:
    - Gradual changes: Memory updates naturally
    - Major migrations: Mark a "reset point" to start fresh
    - Architecture shifts: Old patterns deprecate automatically
    
    You can always**reset memory**if needed (Settings → System).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export/import memory?">
**Yes!**For migrations or backups:
    
    ```bash
    # Export memory to JSON
    rubixkube memory export --output memory-backup.json
    
    # Import into new cluster
    rubixkube memory import --input memory-backup.json
    ```
    
    Useful when moving between environments or disaster recovery.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does memory handle false positives?">
### Feedback mechanism:
    1. Memory suggests a fix
    2. You mark it as "not helpful" or "made things worse"
    3. Memory records: This pattern → This fix = Bad outcome
    4. Future: Won't suggest that fix for that pattern
    
**Memory learns from mistakes too.**</Accordion>
