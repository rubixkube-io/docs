description: "Critical safety limitations and high-risk notes for the RubixKube early release."
---

RubixKube is in an early **Alpha** stage. The software is experimental, evolving, and may contain serious defects or incomplete features.  
**Do not treat this release as production-ready.** Please read and accept the following before proceeding.


<Warning>
  RubixKube Alpha must **never** be deployed in production environments.  
  Use only on disposable clusters, sandboxes, or safe local environments.  
  Failure to follow this warning can cause outages, instability, or data loss.
</Warning>


<Callout type="warning" title="Unstable and changing">
  Alpha builds may break without notice. APIs, behaviors, and configurations can change frequently.  
  Expect instability, incompatibility, and limited support.
</Callout>


## Safety and Guardrails

RubixKube includes safety guardrails, but Alpha autonomy is intentionally **limited**.

- Default mode is **observe-only**. Any action that can modify cluster state must be explicitly approved.  
- Apply **minimal RBAC permissions** — never grant cluster-admin.  
- All actions are logged — always review logs for accuracy and rollback readiness.  
- Treat RubixKube as a **change-bearing system**: backups, snapshots, and rollbacks are **mandatory**.

<Callout type="danger" title="Assume failure first">
  Always operate under the assumption that RubixKube Alpha may fail.  
  Safeguard your environment before enabling autonomous features.
</Callout>


## Data and Privacy

- **Do not connect** sensitive, regulated, or customer data during Alpha.  
- Redact API keys, secrets, and credentials before sharing logs.  
- Logs and diagnostics are for troubleshooting only — never for production reporting.  

---

## Compatibility

- Supported: recent stable Kubernetes versions only.  
- Recommended: disposable clusters (Kind, dev EKS/GKE/AKS, or non-production).  
- Integrations: only those explicitly marked as **Alpha supported**.  


## Expected Behavior

During Alpha, you may encounter:  

- Installation issues on certain clusters or providers  
- Limited autofix capability  
- Incomplete dashboards or missing views  
- Performance variability on larger clusters  

<Callout type="info" title="Reporting issues">
  Please capture: Kubernetes version, provider, RubixKube version, and minimal reproduction steps.  
  Detailed reports accelerate fixes and improve Alpha stability.
</Callout>


## Your Responsibility

- You are fully responsible for the safety and stability of your environment.  
- Only use RubixKube Alpha where **failure has zero customer impact**.  
- Always review, confirm, and approve proposed changes before execution.
