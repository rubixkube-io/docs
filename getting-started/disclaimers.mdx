# Disclaimers

RubixKube is in an early Alpha. The software is evolving and may contain defects or incomplete features. Please read and accept the following before proceeding.

<Callout type="warning" title="Not for production use">
  Do not deploy RubixKube to production environments during the Alpha. Use only on test clusters, sandboxes, or local environments.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" title="Best-effort support">
  Alpha builds are provided on a best-effort basis. Breaking changes may occur, and behavior can change without notice.
</Callout>

## Safety and Guardrails

RubixKube includes guardrails to reduce risk, but autonomy is limited in Alpha.

- Default mode is observe-first. Any action that can modify cluster state should be opt-in and explicitly confirmed.
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should grant the minimum permissions required for evaluation.
- All actions should be visible in logs for review and rollback.

<Callout type="warning" title="Change control">
  Treat RubixKube as change-bearing software. Ensure you have backups, rollbacks, or cluster snapshots before experimentation.
</Callout>

## Data and Privacy

- Keep evaluation data non-sensitive. Do not connect confidential or regulated datasets in Alpha.
- Logs and diagnostics are intended for troubleshooting. Redact secrets and keys before sharing.
- If you need to share logs with the team, prefer redacted bundles.

## Compatibility

- Kubernetes versions: target recent stable releases only.
- Cluster type: evaluation is recommended on disposable clusters, e.g., local Kind or a non-production managed cluster.
- Third-party integrations: only those explicitly documented as supported in Alpha should be enabled.

## Expected Behavior

During Alpha, you may encounter:

- Installation issues on specific cluster versions or providers
- Limited autofix coverage
- Incomplete dashboards or views
- Performance variability on large clusters

<Callout type="info" title="Reporting issues">
  Please capture the cluster version, provider, RubixKube version, and a minimal reproduction. This accelerates fixes.
</Callout>

## Your Responsibility

- You are responsible for the security and stability of your environment.
- Use RubixKube only where failure has no customer impact.
- Review and approve any proposed changes before execution.
