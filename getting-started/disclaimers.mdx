description: "Important safety information and limitations for RubixKube Beta release"
---

RubixKube is currently in **Beta**. While significantly more stable than Alpha, the software is still evolving and should be used with appropriate caution.  

**This is NOT a production-ready release.** Please read and understand the following before proceeding.

<Warning>
**⚠️ Not for Production Environments**

RubixKube Beta must **NOT** be deployed in production environments or on critical infrastructure.  

**Safe for:**
- ✅ Development clusters
- ✅ Staging environments  
- ✅ Testing and evaluation
- ✅ Local KIND clusters
- ✅ Non-critical cloud clusters

**NOT safe for:**
- ❌ Production workloads
- ❌ Customer-facing infrastructure
- ❌ Revenue-critical systems
- ❌ Regulated environments (until compliance certification)

Failure to follow this guidance may result in outages, data loss, or service disruptions.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Beta vs Alpha:** Beta builds are more stable than Alpha, but still undergo active development. Features may change, and some functionality may be incomplete.
</Info>


## Safety and Guardrails

RubixKube includes multiple layers of safety guardrails to protect your infrastructure:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Observe-Only by Default" icon="eye">
    Default mode is **read-only observation**. Any action that modifies cluster state requires explicit approval.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Minimal Permissions" icon="key">
    RubixKube operates with **least-privilege RBAC**. Never requires or requests cluster-admin access.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Audit Logging" icon="list">
    Every action is logged with timestamps, user context, and rationale. Complete audit trail maintained.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rollback Ready" icon="rotate-left">
    All changes are reversible. RubixKube tracks configuration history for instant rollbacks.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Autonomous Mode Safety

When you enable autonomous remediation (optional):

- **Blast Radius Limits** - Only fixes scoped resources, never cluster-wide changes
- **Approval Workflows** - High-risk actions require manual approval
- **Dry-Run First** - RubixKube simulates changes before applying
- **Circuit Breakers** - Automatic pause if multiple failures detected

<Warning>
**Best Practice:** Start with observe-only mode, then gradually enable auto-remediation for low-risk scenarios only.
</Warning>


## Data and Privacy

### What RubixKube Collects

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="✅ Data We Collect" icon="check">
    RubixKube observer collects:
    - **Kubernetes metadata** - Pod names, namespaces, labels, annotations
    - **Metrics** - CPU, memory, network usage, health checks
    - **Events** - Kubernetes events and state changes
    - **Resource status** - Deployment health, replica counts
    
    All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="❌ Data We NEVER Collect" icon="xmark">
    RubixKube does **NOT** collect:
    - ❌ Application logs or stdout/stderr
    - ❌ Kubernetes secrets or ConfigMap data
    - ❌ Environment variables containing sensitive data
    - ❌ Your actual business/customer data
    - ❌ Code or container contents
    
    **Privacy First:** We only collect what's necessary for reliability monitoring.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🔒 Security Best Practices" icon="lock">
    **For Beta Testing:**
    - Use non-production data only
    - Avoid clusters with PII or regulated data
    - Redact sensitive information before sharing logs with support
    - Review RubixKube's RBAC permissions regularly
    - Use separate API keys for each environment
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
