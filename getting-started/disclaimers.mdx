description: "Important safety information and limitations for RubixKube Beta release"
---

RubixKube is currently in ** Beta **. While significantly more stable than Alpha, the software is still evolving and should be used with appropriate caution.  

** This is NOT a production-ready release.** Please read and understand the following before proceeding.

<Warning>
### Not for Production Environments
RubixKube Beta must ** NOT ** be deployed in production environments or on critical infrastructure.  

** Safe for:**-  Development clusters
-  Staging environments  
-  Testing and evaluation
-  Local KIND clusters
-  Non-critical cloud clusters

** NOT safe for:**-  Production workloads
-  Customer-facing infrastructure
-  Revenue-critical systems
-  Regulated environments (until compliance certification)

Failure to follow this guidance may result in outages, data loss, or service disruptions.
</Warning>

<Info>
** Beta vs Alpha:** Beta builds are more stable than Alpha, but still undergo active development. Features may change, and some functionality may be incomplete.
</Info>


## Safety and Guardrails

RubixKube includes multiple layers of safety guardrails to protect your infrastructure:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Observe-Only by Default" icon="eye">
    Default mode is ** read-only observation **. Any action that modifies cluster state requires explicit approval.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Minimal Permissions" icon="key">
    RubixKube operates with ** least-privilege RBAC **. Never requires or requests cluster-admin access.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Audit Logging" icon="list">
    Every action is logged with timestamps, user context, and rationale. Complete audit trail maintained.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Rollback Ready" icon="rotate-left">
    All changes are reversible. RubixKube tracks configuration history for instant rollbacks.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Autonomous Mode Safety

When you enable autonomous remediation (optional):

- ** Blast Radius Limits **- Only fixes scoped resources, never cluster-wide changes
- ** Approval Workflows **- High-risk actions require manual approval
- ** Dry-Run First **- RubixKube simulates changes before applying
- ** Circuit Breakers **- Automatic pause if multiple failures detected

<Warning>
** Best Practice:** Start with observe-only mode, then gradually enable auto-remediation for low-risk scenarios only.
</Warning>


## Data and Privacy

### What RubixKube Collects

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=" Data We Collect" icon="check">
    RubixKube observer collects:
    - ** Kubernetes metadata **- Pod names, namespaces, labels, annotations
    - ** Metrics **- CPU, memory, network usage, health checks
    - ** Events **- Kubernetes events and state changes
    - ** Resource status **- Deployment health, replica counts
    
    All data is encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3) and at rest (AES-256).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=" Data We NEVER Collect" icon="xmark">
    RubixKube does ** NOT ** collect:
    -  Application logs or stdout/stderr
    -  Kubernetes secrets or ConfigMap data
    -  Environment variables containing sensitive data
    -  Your actual business/customer data
    -  Code or container contents
    
** Privacy First:** We only collect what's necessary for reliability monitoring.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=" Security Best Practices" icon="lock">
** For Beta Testing:**- Use non-production data only
    - Avoid clusters with PII or regulated data
    - Redact sensitive information before sharing logs with support
    - Review RubixKube's RBAC permissions regularly
    - Use separate API keys for each environment
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
