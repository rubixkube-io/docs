# Welcome to RubixKube Docs

RubixKube™ is the **Reliability Layer for the AI Era** — an AI-native mesh of agents that prevents downtime, safeguards revenue, and gives peace of mind at scale.  

Think of it as your **second brain for infra**:
- 🧠 Observes and understands your systems like a seasoned SRE  
- 🔍 Diagnoses issues and shows you the blast radius  
- ⚡ Proposes or applies safe fixes before customers notice  
- 📊 Connects infrastructure failures to **real business impact**
