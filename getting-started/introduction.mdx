# Welcome to RubixKube Docs

RubixKube™ is the ** Reliability Layer for the AI Era **— an AI-native mesh of agents that prevents downtime, safeguards revenue, and gives peace of mind at scale.  

Think of it as your ** second brain for infra **:
- Observes and understands your systems like a seasoned SRE  
- Diagnoses issues and shows you the blast radius  
- Proposes or applies safe fixes before customers notice  
- Connects infrastructure failures to ** real business impact **
