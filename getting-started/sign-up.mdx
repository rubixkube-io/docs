# Sign Up and Access

To begin using **RubixKube Alpha**, you’ll need to create an account, generate your access token, and set up your evaluation environment.

---

## Step 1: Create an Account

1. Visit the [RubixKube Sign Up Portal](<replace-with-signup-url>).  
2. Enter your work email and verify it.  
3. Complete your profile details — name, team, and organization.  
4. Accept the **Alpha Terms & Disclaimers** before proceeding.

<Warning>
  Use only non-production email and cluster information during Alpha.  
  Production accounts and sensitive data are not supported.
</Warning>

---

## Step 2: Obtain Your Access Token

Once your account is created:

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Access Tokens**.  
2. Generate a new token labeled for your evaluation cluster.  
3. Copy and store the token securely — you will need it for CLI or API authentication.

<Note>
  Treat access tokens like passwords. Do not share them in logs or screenshots.  
  If compromised, revoke immediately and generate a new one.
</Note>

---

## Step 3: Prepare Your Evaluation Environment

RubixKube Alpha should run only on safe, disposable clusters.

- **Recommended:** Kind, Minikube, or a non-production EKS/GKE/AKS cluster.  
- **Not allowed:** Production workloads, sensitive datasets, or regulated environments.  
- Ensure your cluster is reachable from your local machine and has kubectl access.

## Step 4: Install the RubixKube CLI

Download and install the CLI to interact with your account and clusters.

```bash
curl -sSL <replace-with-cli-install-script> | bash
rubixkube version
````

Authenticate with your token:

```bash
rubixkube auth --token <your-access-token>
```
