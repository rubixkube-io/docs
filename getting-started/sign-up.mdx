# Sign Up and Access

Before installing RubixKube, you need to create an account and obtain your credentials. These will allow you to connect your clusters securely.

## Create an Account

<Card
  title="Sign Up"
  icon="user-plus"
  href="https://console.rubixkube.ai"
  horizontal
>
  Visit the sign-up page to register. Use a valid email address that you control. Verification is required.
</Card>

Once registered:

1. Verify your email address by clicking the link in your inbox.  
2. Log in to the [RubixKube Console](https://console.rubixkube.ai).  
3. Navigate to **Access Tokens** in your profile.

## Generate an Access Token

Tokens are required for installation and CLI use.

<Callout type="info" title="Token scope">
  Tokens are environment-specific. For Alpha, generate a **sandbox** token and avoid production clusters.
</Callout>

Steps:

1. In the Console, go to **Access Tokens → Generate New Token**.  
2. Name the token (e.g., `alpha-kind-cluster`).  
3. Copy the generated token. Store it securely — you will not see it again.

## CLI Setup

During installation, you will use the token to connect RubixKube to your cluster:

```bash
rubixkube login --token <YOUR_TOKEN>
