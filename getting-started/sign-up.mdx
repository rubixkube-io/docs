## Step 1: Create an account

To sign up for RubixKube:

1. Go to the sign‑up portal: [RubixKube sign‑up](<replace-with-signup-url>).
2. Enter your work email and verify it.
3. Fill in your profile details — name, team and organisation.
4. Review and accept the Alpha terms and disclaimer.

<Warning>
Use only non‑production email addresses and cluster names during Alpha. Do not include any sensitive details.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Generate an access token

After your account is created:

1. Navigate to **Dashboard → Access tokens**.
2. Create a new token for your evaluation cluster.
3. Copy the token and store it securely; you’ll need it to authenticate CLI and API requests.

<Note>
Treat access tokens like passwords. Do not share them. If a token is compromised, revoke it immediately and generate a new one.
</Note>

## Step 3: Prepare an evaluation cluster

RubixKube Alpha must run on safe, disposable clusters:

- Recommended: Kind, Minikube or a non‑production EKS/GKE/AKS cluster.
- Not allowed: Production workloads or regulated datasets.
- Ensure you have `kubectl` access to the cluster from your local machine.

## Step 4: Install the RubixKube CLI

Install the CLI and authenticate with your token:

```bash
curl -sSL <replace-with-cli-install-script> | bash
rubixkube version
````

Authenticate:

```bash
rubixkube auth --token <your-access-token>
```
