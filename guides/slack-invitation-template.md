### Option 1: For Internal Team (Slack Message)

```
Hello [Team/Person],

I've been evaluating RubixKube for our Kubernetes infrastructure monitoring, and I believe it could significantly improve our incident response time and operational efficiency.

RubixKube provides:
• Automated issue detection with root cause analysis
• Conversational infrastructure access via AI Chat
• 85% faster incident resolution (based on early testing)
• Resource optimization and cost analysis

I've set up a test environment and would value your input on whether this fits our needs.

Would you be interested in reviewing the platform? I can walk you through the key features, or you can explore independently:

• Create account: https://console.rubixkube.ai/signup
• Documentation: https://docs.rubixkube.ai
• Quick start guide: https://docs.rubixkube.ai/tutorials/first-steps

Note: This is Beta software - safe for dev/staging but not production yet.

Let me know your thoughts.

### Option 2: For Decision Makers (Email/Slack)

```
Subject: Proposal to Evaluate RubixKube for Infrastructure Reliability

Hi [Name],

I recommend we evaluate RubixKube as a solution for improving our Kubernetes operational efficiency.

**The Problem:**
Our team currently spends significant time on manual cluster monitoring, incident investigation, and reactive firefighting. Average time per incident: 20-30 minutes.

**Proposed Solution:**
RubixKube provides AI-powered infrastructure reliability with automated detection, root cause analysis, and guided remediation.

**Expected Impact:**
• 85-90% reduction in incident resolution time
• Proactive issue detection before customer impact
• Institutional knowledge capture (no more tribal knowledge)
• Resource cost optimization (early tests show 40-60% savings potential)

**Risk Assessment:**
• Beta software - approved for non-production environments only
• Free during Beta period
• Minimal RBAC permissions required
• Can be uninstalled cleanly if not suitable

**Next Steps:**
If approved, I can:
1. Set up 2-week evaluation on staging cluster
2. Document findings and ROI
3. Present recommendation for broader adoption

**Resources:**
• Product overview: https://docs.rubixkube.ai/getting-started/introduction
• Technical docs: https://docs.rubixkube.ai
• Beta disclaimers: https://docs.rubixkube.ai/getting-started/disclaimers

Please let me know if you'd like to proceed with the evaluation.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Option 3: For Technical Peers (Casual Slack)

```
Hey [Name],

Quick heads up - I've been testing RubixKube for Kubernetes monitoring and it's pretty impressive.

TLDR:
• AI that actually detects and explains pod failures
• Chat interface for cluster queries (no more kubectl grep hell)
• Saved me 15 mins this morning debugging an OOMKilled issue

If you're interested in trying it:
• Sign up: https://console.rubixkube.ai/signup (free Beta)
• Docs: https://docs.rubixkube.ai
• Best tutorial: https://docs.rubixkube.ai/tutorials/chat-basics

Worth checking out if you deal with K8s incidents regularly.

Caveat: Beta only, don't put on prod yet.

### Option 4: For Engineering Managers

```
Subject: RubixKube Beta Evaluation - Request for Approval

Hi [Manager Name],

I'm requesting approval to evaluate RubixKube for our team's Kubernetes operations.

**What it is:**
AI-powered infrastructure reliability platform that automates incident detection, root cause analysis, and provides remediation guidance.

**Why I'm interested:**
• Our team currently spends 10-15 hours/week on manual incident investigation
• RubixKube promises 85% time reduction (industry average)
• Potential cost savings from resource optimization
• Builds institutional knowledge vs. tribal knowledge

**Evaluation Plan:**
• Duration: 2 weeks
• Scope: Staging cluster only (not production)
• Cost: Free (Beta period)
• Risk: Minimal (read-only observation mode)
• Team time: 2 hours setup + 30 min daily monitoring

**Deliverables:**
• Incident resolution time comparison (before/after)
• Resource optimization opportunities identified
• ROI analysis
• Recommendation: adopt, reject, or revisit later

**Required Resources:**
• Approval to install observer agent on staging cluster
• Access to https://console.rubixkube.ai for team
• 2 weeks evaluation period

**Documentation Review:**
• Technical overview: https://docs.rubixkube.ai/concepts/what-is-sri
• Security & permissions: https://docs.rubixkube.ai/getting-started/disclaimers
• Installation guide: https://docs.rubixkube.ai/getting-started/installation-cloud

May I proceed with the evaluation?

Best regards,
[Your Name]

• Long incident resolution times
• Lack of institutional knowledge
• Resource waste and cost overruns

**Current Status:**
• Beta release (free access)
• Approved for dev/staging environments
• Production-ready release: Q1 2026

**How to Evaluate:**
If this sounds relevant to your team:

1. **Learn:** https://docs.rubixkube.ai/getting-started/introduction
2. **Try:** https://console.rubixkube.ai/signup (15-minute setup)
3. **Explore:** https://docs.rubixkube.ai/tutorials/first-steps

**Technical Details:**
• Docs: https://docs.rubixkube.ai
• Architecture: https://docs.rubixkube.ai/concepts/agent-mesh

## Response to Common Questions

### "Is it safe?"

> "Yes, for non-production environments. RubixKube operates in observe-only mode by default and requires minimal permissions. It cannot modify your cluster without explicit approval. Full details: https://docs.rubixkube.ai/getting-started/disclaimers"

### "How much does it cost?"

> "Currently free during Beta. Production pricing TBD for Q1 2026 release. No credit card required for Beta access."

### "How long to set up?"

> "15 minutes end-to-end. Account creation (2 min) + cluster connection (5 min) + initial exploration (8 min). Guide: https://docs.rubixkube.ai/getting-started/installation-kind"

### "What if we don't like it?"

> "Uninstall is one kubectl command. No data lock-in. Your cluster is unchanged. RubixKube only observes, doesn't modify infrastructure."

### "Can I try it alone first?"

> "Absolutely. Create account, connect a local KIND cluster, and evaluate privately. When ready, invite team: https://docs.rubixkube.ai/using/workspace"
