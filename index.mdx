# Welcome to RubixKube™

### The Reliability Layer for the AI Era
RubixKube is an AI-native mesh of agents that prevents downtime, safeguards revenue, and gives you peace of mind at scale. Think of it as your**second brain for infrastructure**— one that never sleeps, never forgets, and always protects your uptime.

<Info>
**Currently in Beta**- RubixKube is ready for testing on dev/staging environments. Production-ready release coming soon!
