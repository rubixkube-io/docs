# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you quickly diagnose and resolve common issues across the RubixKube platform.

## Quick Checklist

- Verify connectivity: Dashboard refresh succeeds, no global 401/403 errors
- Confirm agent health: Observer, RCA Pipeline, SRI are Active
- Check cluster readiness: kube-apiserver reachable, nodes Ready
- Review Insights errors: open the latest incident and read Evidence
- Hard refresh docs if images fail: Cmd+Shift+R

---

## Authentication and Access

### 401 Unauthorized in console
- Cause: Session expired or missing tenant context
- Fix:
  1. Click Refresh in the header or re-login
  2. If persistent, clear cookies for the console domain
  3. Verify Tenant ID exists in Settings → Organization

### Can't login
- Cause: SSO blocked or clock skew
- Fix:
  - Ensure system time is correct
  - Try alternate provider (Google/GitHub)
  - Contact support with timestamp and email

---

## Dashboard/Insights Issues

### Images not rendering in docs
- Cause: Browser cache or missing images
- Fix:
  1. Clear Mintlify cache locally (.mintlify) and rebuild
  2. Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
  3. Confirm path: `/images/using/...` and commit pushed

### Insights page blank or parsing error
- Cause: MDX invalid tag usage
- Fix:
  - Wrap CLI placeholders in fenced code blocks
  - Avoid bare `<tag>` text; escape or code block it

---

## Agents & RCA

### Agents show Inactive
- Cause: Pods not running in `rubixkube-system`
- Fix:
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n rubixkube-system
  kubectl logs deploy/rubixkube-observer -n rubixkube-system
  ```
  - Verify image pull and service account permissions

### RCA not generated
- Cause: Missing evidence or low signal
- Fix:
  - Ensure logs/metrics sources are reachable
  - Re-run investigation; increase time range

---

## Clusters & Infrastructure

### No clusters found
- Cause: Observer not installed
- Fix:
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f "https://api.rubixkube.ai/install/observer.yaml?apiKey=YOUR_KEY"
  ```
  - Wait 1–2 minutes; verify nodes and pods are Ready

### Graph not rendering
- Cause: WebGL/canvas blocked
- Fix:
  - Try different layout (Force/Hierarchical)
  - Disable extensions blocking canvas

---

## Settings & Integrations

### Tenant ID copy button not working
- Cause: Clipboard permissions
- Fix: Use manual selection; check browser clipboard settings

### Slack/PagerDuty not receiving alerts
- Cause: Not configured or wrong keys
- Fix:
  - Reconnect integration and re-enter key
  - Trigger a test event from Insights

---

## Collecting Diagnostics

Provide the following when contacting support:
- Tenant ID (Settings → Organization)
- Timestamp and timezone
- Browser and OS
- Repro steps and screenshots
- Relevant `kubectl` outputs
