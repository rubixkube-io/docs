# Detecting Container Image Issues

One of the most common Kubernetes failures is **ImagePullBackOff**  - when a pod can't pull its container image. Let's see how RubixKube detects and helps you resolve this issue.

## The Scenario

We'll intentionally create a pod with an invalid container image to trigger an **ImagePullBackOff**  error, then watch RubixKube detect it.

### Create the Failing Pod

Deploy a pod with a non-existent image:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: broken-image-demo
  namespace: rubixkube-tutorials
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nonexistent-registry.io/invalid-image:v1.0
    imagePullPolicy: Always
```

### Apply it:
```bash
kubectl create namespace rubixkube-tutorials
kubectl apply -f broken-image-pod.yaml
```

---

## Watch Kubernetes Fail

Check the pod status:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n rubixkube-tutorials
```

### Expected output:
```
NAME                READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
broken-image-demo   0/1     ImagePullBackOff   0          2m
```

**What's happening:** 1. Kubernetes tries to pull `nonexistent-registry.io/invalid-image:v1.0`
2. Registry doesn't exist → Pull fails
3. Kubernetes retries with exponential backoff
4. Status cycles:**Pending **  →**Pending **  →**Pending** 
<Accordion title="See the Kubernetes events">
  ```bash
  kubectl describe pod broken-image-demo -n rubixkube-tutorials
  ```
  
**Key events:** ```
  Warning  Failed     2m (x4 over 3m)  kubelet
           Failed to pull image "nonexistent-registry.io/invalid-image:v1.0": 
           failed to resolve reference: failed to do request: 
           Head "https://nonexistent-registry.io/...": 
           dial tcp: lookup nonexistent-registry.io: no such host

           Error: ErrImagePull
  
  Warning  Failed     1m (x8 over 3m)  kubelet

## RubixKube Detection (1-2 Minutes)

Now open the [RubixKube Dashboard](https://console.rubixkube.ai/dashboard).

### Within 1-2 minutes, you'll see:
<Frame>
  <img
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
    src="/images/tutorials/tutorial-02-dashboard-with-failures.png"
    alt="Dashboard showing detected ImagePullBackOff"
  />
</Frame>

### What RubixKube Detected

**Activity Feed shows:** -  New incident appeared
-**Type:**  Image pull failure  
-**Severity:**  Medium (not critical, but needs fixing)
-**Status:**  Active

**Active Insights increased** from 0 to 1+ (or higher if multiple issues)

<Tip>
**Detection is automatic!** You didn't configure any alerts or rules. RubixKube's Observer Agent continuously watches your cluster and reports anomalies.
</Tip>

## Viewing the Incident Details

Click on **Insights**  in the navigation to see detailed analysis:

<Frame>
  <img
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
    src="/images/tutorials/tutorial-03-insights-with-detections.png"
    alt="Insights page showing incident analysis"
  />
</Frame>

### Incident Information

### You'll see:
| Field | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Type**  | ImagePullBackOff | Kubernetes can't pull the image |
| **Severity**  | Medium | Not critical but needs attention |
| **Affected Resource**  | Pod/broken-image-demo | Which pod is impacted |
| **Namespace**  | rubixkube-tutorials | Where the pod lives |
| **Detected**  | 2 minutes ago | When RubixKube first saw it |
| **Confidence**  | 90%+ | How certain RubixKube is about the diagnosis |

### AI-Generated Suggestions

RubixKube provides actionable recommendations:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title=" Verify the image name and tag">
**Why:** Typos in image names are the #1 cause of ImagePullBackOff
    
**Check:**    - Is the registry URL correct?
    - Does the image exist in that registry?
    - Is the tag valid? (`:latest`, `:v1.0`, etc.)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=" Check registry accessibility">
**Why:** Private registries require authentication
    
**Verify:**    - Can your cluster reach the registry?
    - Are imagePullSecrets configured?
    - Does the service account have access?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=" Review imagePullPolicy">
**Why:** Policy affects when Kubernetes pulls images
    
**Options:**    - `Always` - Pull on every pod start (good for `:latest`)
    - `IfNotPresent` - Use cached image if available
    - `Never` - Only use local images
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title=" Check for network policies blocking egress">
**Why:** Network policies might prevent outbound connections
    
**Test:**    ```bash
    kubectl run test-curl --rm -i --image=curlimages/curl -- \
      curl -I https://registry-1.docker.io
    ```
    
    If this fails, network policies may be blocking registry access.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Fixing the Issue

For our scenario, the image simply doesn't exist. Let's fix it:

### Option 1: Use a Valid Image

```bash
kubectl delete pod broken-image-demo -n rubixkube-tutorials
```

Then deploy with a real image:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: fixed-image-demo
  namespace: rubixkube-tutorials
spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
    image: nginx:latest  # Valid image
    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f fixed-pod.yaml
```

### Option 2: Fix In-Place (if image was a typo)

```bash
kubectl edit pod broken-image-demo -n rubixkube-tutorials
```

Change `image:` to a valid one, save, and Kubernetes will recreate the container.

---

## Verify the Fix

Check the pod status:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n rubixkube-tutorials
```

### Success looks like:
```
NAME              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
fixed-image-demo   1/1     Running   0          30s
```

**In RubixKube Dashboard:** - ** In RubixKube Dashboard:** decreases (issue resolved)
- **Activity Feed** shows resolution event
- **System Health** improves

<Note>
**RubixKube tracks resolution!** Once you fix the issue, RubixKube detects the recovery and updates the incident status to "Resolved".
</Note>

## What RubixKube Learned

After you fix this issue, the **Memory Engine**  stores:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="The Problem" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    ImagePullBackOff on pod `broken-image-demo` due to non-existent registry
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="The Fix" icon="check">
    Replaced with valid image `nginx:latest` → Pod started successfully
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Time to Resolve" icon="clock">
    Detection: 2 minutes, Manual fix: 30 seconds, Total: 2.5 minutes
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Pattern Stored" icon="database">
    If similar error occurs again, RubixKube will recognize the pattern faster
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### This knowledge helps with future incidents!

## Common ImagePullBackOff Causes

Based on RubixKube's Memory Engine and common patterns:

| Cause | Frequency | Fix Time | Prevention |
|-------|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Typo in image name**  | 40% | 1 min | Automation, validation |
| **Missing image tag**  | 25% | 2 min | Always specify tags |
| **Private registry auth**  | 20% | 5 min | Configure imagePullSecrets |
| **Network policy blocking**  | 10% | 10 min | Allow egress to registries |
| **Registry rate limiting**  | 5% | 15 min | Use image caching |

<Tip>
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Always use specific image tags (`:v1.2.3`) instead of `:latest`. This prevents unexpected changes and makes rollbacks easier.
</Tip>
