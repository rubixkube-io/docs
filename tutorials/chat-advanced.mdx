# Advanced Chat: Personas & Workflows

You've learned the basics and troubleshooting. Now let's explore how different team members use Chat for their specific workflows, plus advanced features and power user tips.

<Info>
**Role-based approach:** See how SREs, DevOps Engineers, Platform Engineers, and Developers each use Chat differently to maximize productivity.
</Info>

## Different Personas, Different Workflows

###  SRE: "Everything is On Fire"

**Goal:** Triage and resolve production incidents FAST

**Morning routine:**
```
"Good morning! Any HIGH severity incidents?"
"Show me production pod health"
"What changed overnight?"
```

**During incident:**
```
"URGENT: What's down in production?"
↓
"Which services are affected?"
↓
"Root cause for checkout-service failure?"
↓
"How do I rollback?"
↓
"Is it fixed?"
```

**Time: 3-5 minutes** (vs. 20+ minutes)

**Post-mortem:**
```
"Summarize today's incidents"
"What was the root cause?"
"How long was each service down?"
"Export this conversation for the post-mortem doc"
```

<Tip>
**SRE Pro Tip:** Use "URGENT" or "production" in your query - the agent understands priority and responds accordingly.
</Tip>

---

###  DevOps Engineer: "Deploy Safely"

**Goal:** Validate and deploy without breaking things

**Pre-deployment checklist:**
```
1. "Status of api-gateway deployment?"
2. "Any recent issues with api-gateway?"
3. [Upload new-deployment.yaml via ]
4. "Validate this deployment"
5. "What's the blast radius if this fails?"
6. "Looks good - deploying now"
```

**Post-deployment verification:**
```
"How's the new api-gateway version?"
"Any errors in the logs?"
"Resource usage vs. previous version?"
```

**During rollout:**
```
"Are new pods coming up?"
"Any errors during rollout?"
"Should I continue or rollback?"
```

<Note>
**Chat becomes your deployment co-pilot** - validates changes, monitors rollouts, suggests rollbacks if needed.
</Note>

---

###  Platform Engineer: "Optimize Everything"

**Goal:** Resource efficiency and capacity planning

**Resource optimization:**
```
"Show me pods with limits less than requests"
"What pods are over-provisioned?"
"Calculate actual vs. requested resources"
"Which deployments need autoscaling?"
"Resource waste by namespace"
```

**Capacity planning:**
```
"Cluster utilization percentage?"
"How many more pods can we run?"
"Memory headroom per node?"
"Project resource needs for 2x traffic"
```

**Cost optimization:**
```
"What pods consume the most resources?"
"Show me idle resources"
"Which nodes are underutilized?"
```

<Tip>
**Platform Engineer Tip:** Ask for comparisons! "Compare dev vs. prod resource usage" helps identify over-provisioning in lower environments.
</Tip>

---

###  Junior Developer: "Teach Me"

**Goal:** Learn Kubernetes while working

**Learning queries:**
```
"What is a pod?"
"Explain CrashLoopBackOff in simple terms"
"Why does Kubernetes kill OOM pods?"
"What's the difference between Deployment and Pod?"
"How do resource limits work?"
```

**Exploration:**
```
"What applications are deployed here?"
"How does payment-service connect to the database?"
"What technologies are we using?"
"Show me an example of a healthy pod"
```

**Safe experimentation:**
```
"If I delete this pod, what happens?"
"What would breaking this service impact?"
"Is it safe to restart api-gateway?"
```

<Note>
**The agent becomes a patient teacher** - explains concepts with examples from YOUR cluster, not generic docs.
</Note>

---

## Sample Workflows by Time of Day

###  Morning (9 AM): Health Check

```
"Good morning! Cluster status?"
→ Get: Health %, pod counts, active incidents

"Any issues overnight?"
→ Get: Events from last 8 hours

"All clear for deploys today?"
→ Get: Risk assessment
```

**Time: 30 seconds**  
**Result:** Confident to start the day

---

###  Afternoon (2 PM): Pre-Deployment

```
"Status of payment-service?"
→ Current state, recent issues

[Upload new-deployment.yaml]
"Validate this"
→ Security, resource, config checks

"What's the risk?"
→ Blast radius analysis

"Deploying now - monitor it"
→ Agent watches for issues
```

**Time: 2 minutes**  
**Result:** Safe deployment

---

###  Evening (8 PM): Post-Deploy Check

```
"How's the new payment-service?"
→ Pod status, errors, metrics

"Resource usage vs. old version?"
→ Before/after comparison

"Any regressions?"
→ Error rate, latency check
```

**Time: 1 minute**  
**Result:** Sleep well, knowing it's stable

---

###  3 AM: Incident Response

```
"URGENT: What's down?"
→ Failing pods, services affected

"Root cause?"
→ Fast RCA

"How do I fix it?"
→ Step-by-step remediation
```

**Time: 3 minutes**  
**Result:** Back to sleep

---

## Advanced Features

###  File Upload & YAML Validation

Click **** to upload Kubernetes YAML files.

**Use cases:**
- Pre-deployment validation
- Security audits
- Best practice checks
- Configuration review

**Example workflow:**

1. Click 
2. Select `deployment.yaml`
3. Agent analyzes automatically

**Sample response:**
```
Analyzed your deployment:

 Valid YAML syntax
 Resource limits defined
  Warning: No liveness probe
  Warning: Running as root
 Error: Missing imagePullSecret

Recommendations:
1. Add livenessProbe for health checks
2. Set runAsNonRoot: true
3. Create imagePullSecret

Would you like a fixed version?
```

## Query Best Practices Expanded

###  DO This

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Include Namespace" icon="folder">
    **Good:** "Show failing pods in prod"
    
    **Why:** Faster, more accurate
  </Card>

  <Card title="Specify Resource Type" icon="cube">
    **Good:** "Why is pod api-gateway failing?"
    
    **Why:** Clearer than just "api-gateway"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Ask Follow-Ups" icon="messages">
    **Good:** "Tell me more" or "What about logs?"
    
    **Why:** Leverages context
  </Card>

  <Card title="Use Urgency Keywords" icon="siren">
    **Good:** "URGENT" or "production down"
    
    **Why:** Agent prioritizes
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

###  DON'T Do This

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Don't Repeat Context" icon="ban">
    **Bad:** Asking full question again when in conversation
    
    **Why:** Agent remembers
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Be Too Vague" icon="question">
    **Bad:** "Fix it" (without context)
    
    **Why:** Agent needs to know WHAT
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Use kubectl Syntax" icon="terminal">
    **Bad:** "kubectl get pods -A"
    
    **Why:** Just ask! "Show me all pods"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Assume Omniscience" icon="crystal-ball">
    **Bad:** "Why is it slow?" (which "it"?)
    
    **Why:** Be specific: "Why is checkout-service slow?"
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## Beta Limitations & Workarounds

<Warning>
**Current Limitations:**

**Chat CANNOT (yet):**
- Execute kubectl commands for you
- Apply configuration changes
- Restart pods/deployments
- Create/modify resources

**Workarounds:**
- Agent provides kubectl commands → You run them
- Agent suggests YAML changes → You apply them
- Agent explains steps → You execute them

**Coming Q1 2026:** Automated execution with approval workflow
