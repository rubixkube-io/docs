# Chat Basics: Your First Queries

Welcome to RubixKube's**conversational interface**! This tutorial walks you through your first Chat queries with real screenshots and responses from the SRI Agent.

<Info>
**Hands-on approach:**We'll type real queries, show you actual responses, and explain what's happening at each step. By the end, you'll be comfortable using Chat for daily tasks.
</Info>

## What is the Chat Interface?

The**Chat**is your natural language gateway to infrastructure intelligence. Instead of:
- Remembering complex `kubectl` commands
- Navigating multiple dashboards
- Searching through logs manually

**You simply ask questions**like you would to a colleague:

```
"What pods are failing?"
"Why is memory-hog-demo crashing?"
"Show me resource usage"
```

The**SRI Agent**responds with data from YOUR cluster, not generic answers.

---

## Opening Chat for the First Time

### Step 1: Navigate to Chat

Click**Chat**in the left navigation or press `⌘K` and type "chat".

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/chat/chat-query-health-check.png"
    alt="Chat interface - clean slate"
  />
</Frame>

**What you see:**
| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
|**Message Box**| Where you type your questions |
|**SRI Agent**| The AI assistant you're talking to |
|**Attachment**| Upload YAML files for analysis |
|**Quick Actions**| Pre-built query categories |
|**Chat History**| Your past conversations (left sidebar) |

---

## Your First Query: "What pods are failing?"

Let's start with a common question every engineer asks.

### Type the Query

In the message box, type:

```
What pods are failing in my cluster?
```

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/chat/chat-query-01-typed.png"
    alt="First query typed in chat"
  />
</Frame>

Press**Enter**to send.

---

### Watch the Agent Think

The SRI Agent immediately starts working. You'll see its reasoning process:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/chat/chat-response-01-failing-pods.png"
    alt="Agent analyzing the query"
  />
</Frame>

**What's happening:**
<Steps>
  <Step title="Thought: Identifying Failing Pods">
    The agent plans its approach - "How do I find failing pods?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Function Call: fetch_kubernetes_graph_snapshot">
    The agent queries your Kubernetes cluster
  </Step>

  <Step title="Executed Function">
    The query completed - agent got the data
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analysis">
    Agent processes results and formulates a response
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Complete transparency!**You can see EXACTLY what the agent is doing - every function call, every thought. This builds trust and helps you understand how it works.
</Note>

---

### The Response

The agent responds with intelligent analysis:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/chat/chat-response-02-complete.png"
    alt="Complete agent response with guidance"
  />
</Frame>

**Example response:**
> "I've checked for pods and deployments in the `default` namespace and found nothing.
>
>**This suggests one of the following:**> - There are no workloads in the `default` namespace
> - Your applications are in other namespaces
> - The cluster is new or empty
>
>**To help you, could you tell me:**> - Which namespace are your applications in?"

<Tip>
**The agent asks clarifying questions!**It doesn't fail silently - it guides you to provide the information it needs. This is intelligent assistance.
</Tip>

---

## Following Up: Natural Conversation

Chat remembers context. You can respond naturally:

**You type:**`"Check the rubixkube-tutorials namespace"`

**Agent responds:**
<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/chat/chat-response-03-namespace-query.png"
    alt="Agent investigating specific namespace"
  />
</Frame>

> "Of course, Connect. I'll check the `rubixkube-tutorials` namespace for you."

**Notice:**-  You didn't repeat "show me failing pods"
-  Agent understood the context
-  Conversation flows naturally

"Any pods hitting resource limits?"
```

**Expected:**Current metrics, comparisons, limit violations

---

### Learning Queries

```
"What is a pod?"
"Explain CrashLoopBackOff"
"What does ImagePullBackOff mean?"

## What Makes Chat Different?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Cluster-Aware" icon="server">
    Responses use YOUR actual cluster data, not generic Kubernetes knowledge
  </Card>

  <Card title="Context Memory" icon="brain">
    Maintains conversation thread - no need to repeat yourself
  </Card>

  <Card title="Multi-Agent Backend" icon="robot">
    Coordinates with Observer, RCA, and Memory agents
  </Card>

  <Card title="RCA Integration" icon="magnifying-glass-chart">
    Can explain incidents detected by RubixKube
  </Card>

  <Card title="Learning Mode" icon="graduation-cap">
    Teaches Kubernetes concepts with cluster examples
  </Card>

  <Card title="Transparent" icon="eye">
    Shows its reasoning - you see how it thinks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## Beta Limitations

<Warning>
**What Chat DOES (Beta):**-  Answer questions about your cluster
-  Analyze incidents and provide RCA
-  Explain Kubernetes concepts
-  Provide troubleshooting guidance
-  Show you kubectl commands to run

**What Chat CANNOT do (Yet):**-  Execute kubectl commands automatically
-  Apply configuration changes
-  Restart pods or deployments

**Coming Q1 2026:**Automated execution with approval gates

For now,**Chat is advisory**- it tells you WHAT and HOW, you execute.
</Warning>

---

## Tips for Effective Queries

<Accordion title=" DO: Be Specific">
**Good:**- "Show me OOMKilled pods in production"
- "Why did payment-service-v2 fail?"

**Why:**Specific queries = specific answers
</Accordion>

<Accordion title=" DON'T: Be Vague">
**Avoid:**- "Fix everything"
- "What's wrong?"

**Why:**Agent needs context
</Accordion>

<Accordion title=" DO: Use Natural Language">
**Good:**- "What's broken?"
- "Why is this pod unhappy?"

**Why:**Agent understands casual phrasing
</Accordion>

<Accordion title=" DON'T: Use kubectl Syntax">
**Avoid:**- "kubectl get pods -n prod"

**Why:**Just ask! "Show me pods in prod"
</Accordion>
