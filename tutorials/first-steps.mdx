# Your First 15 Minutes with RubixKube

Welcome! You've installed RubixKube and connected your cluster. Now let's explore the interface and see what RubixKube can do. This tutorial takes about** 15 minutes**and gives you a solid foundation.

<Info>
**Prerequisites:**-  RubixKube account created
-  Observer agent installed on your cluster (KIND or cloud)
-  Logged into [console.rubixkube.ai](https://console.rubixkube.ai)
</Info>

---

## Step 1: Understanding the Dashboard

After logging in, you'll land on the**Dashboard**- your command center for infrastructure reliability.

<Frame>
  <img
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
    src="/images/dashboard/dashboard-02-full-view-no-chat.png"
    alt="RubixKube Dashboard overview"
  />
</Frame>

### Main Metrics at a Glance

The dashboard shows 4 key metrics:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="System Health" icon="heart-pulse">
### 100% = Healthy
    Overall health of your infrastructure based on pod status, resource usage, and incident history
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Active Insights" icon="lightbulb">
### Number of issues detected
    Current problems RubixKube has identified that need attention (pods failing, resource issues, etc.)
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Intelligent Analysis" icon="brain">
### RCA Reports generated
    Root Cause Analysis reports created by the RCA Pipeline Agent
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Agents" icon="robot">
### 3/3 Active
    Status of AI agents monitoring your cluster (Observer, RCA Pipeline, Memory, SRI)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

---

## Step 2: Check Your Cluster Connection

Scroll down to the**Infrastructure**panel to verify your cluster is connected:

<Frame>
  <img
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
    src="/images/dashboard/clusters-01-list-view.png"
    alt="Connected cluster showing resources"
  />
</Frame>

**What you'll see:**- **Connected**status (green indicator)
- **Node count**- How many nodes in your cluster
- **Pod count**- Total pods running
- **Deployments**- Number of deployments
- **Services**- Exposed services

<Tip>
**First time?**If you just installed, you might see low numbers. Deploy some workloads to see RubixKube monitor them!
</Tip>

---

## Step 3: Explore the Navigation

RubixKube's interface is organized into logical sections:

###**Core Section**
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dashboard" icon="gauge">
**What:**Overview of system health and recent activity  
**When to use:**Daily check-in, incident triage  
**Key info:**Metrics, insights, activity feed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Chat" icon="comments">

**Try asking:**"What pods are failing?" or "Show me memory usage"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

###**Monitoring Section**
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Insights" icon="lightbulb">
**What:**Detailed view of all detected issues

## Step 4: View Active Agents

Navigate to**Agents**to see your AI team:

<Frame>
  <img
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
    src="/images/dashboard/agents-01-list-view.png"
    alt="Active AI agents in RubixKube"
  />
</Frame>

### You should see 3 active agents:
| Agent | Role | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
|**RCA Pipeline Agent**| Analyzes incidents and generates root cause reports |  Active |
|**RubixKube Observer Agent**| Monitors your cluster continuously |  Active |
|**SRI Agent**| Provides conversational interface via Chat |  Active |

<Note>
**All agents active = RubixKube is fully operational!**They work together to detect, analyze, and help you resolve issues.
</Note>

---

## Step 5: Try the Chat Interface

Click**Chat**in the navigation to access the conversational interface:

<Frame>
  <img
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
    src="/images/dashboard/chat-01-main-interface.png"
    alt="RubixKube Chat interface with SRI Agent"
  />
</Frame>

### Quick Actions Available

The Chat interface offers pre-built action categories:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Infrastructure" icon="server">
    Manage clusters, nodes, and resources
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security" icon="shield">
    Security analysis and compliance checks
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitoring" icon="chart-line">
    Performance metrics and alerts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Troubleshoot" icon="wrench">
    Debug issues and analyze logs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Networking" icon="network-wired">
    Network policies and connectivity
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Try Your First Query

Type a question in the chat box:

**Example queries to try:**```
"What pods are running in my cluster?"
"Show me any failing pods"
"What's the memory usage across all pods?"
"Are there any recent events I should know about?"
```

<Tip>
<strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Use natural language! The SRI Agent understands questions the way you'd ask a colleague.
</Tip>

---

## Step 6: Understanding the Activity Feed

Back on the**Dashboard**, the**Activity Feed**shows recent events:

**What you'll see:**-**Incidents detected**- Pod crashes, resource issues
-**Insights generated**- AI analysis of problems
-**Resolution events**- When issues are fixed
-**Configuration changes**- Deployments, scaling events

**Example Activity:**```
 Container experiencing repeated crashes in crash-loop-demo
   Severity: medium | Status: active | 2 minutes ago

 Out of memory (OOMKilled) detected on Pod/memory-hog-demo
   Severity: HIGH | Status: active | 2 minutes ago
```

<Note>
**Activity Feed is live**- it updates in real-time as RubixKube detects issues. No refresh needed!
</Note>

---

## Step 7: Check the RCA Live Stream

The**RCA Live Stream**shows the RCA Pipeline Agent working in real-time:

**What you'll see:**- Function calls being made
- Analysis in progress
- Evidence gathering
- Pattern matching

### This is the AI at work!
<Accordion title="What does 'RCA_IN_PROGRESS' mean?">
  When RubixKube detects an incident, the RCA Pipeline Agent immediately starts analyzing:
  
  1.**Gathering evidence**- Logs, metrics, events
  2.**Correlating data**- Finding relationships
  3.**Identifying root cause**- Determining what went wrong
  4.**Generating suggestions**- Proposing fixes
  
  This usually takes** 30-90 seconds**. You'll see the progress percentage.
</Accordion>

---

## Step 8: Explore Settings

Navigate to**Settings**to configure your RubixKube instance:

<Frame>
  <img
    style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }}
    src="/images/settings/settings-01-main-page.png"
    alt="RubixKube Settings page"

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Dashboard shows 'Initializing...' forever">
**Possible causes:**- Observer agent not connected
    - Network connectivity issue
    - Browser cache problem
    
**Solutions:** 1. Check observer pod: `kubectl get pods -n rubixkube`
    2. Verify it's running (STATUS = Running)
    3. Clear browser cache and refresh
    4. Try different browser
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Agents showing as offline">
    **Check:**
    1. Navigate to Agents page
    2. Look for "Last active" timestamp
    3. If >5 minutes ago, agent may be unhealthy

    **Fix:**
    ```bash
    kubectl logs -n rubixkube deployment/rubixkube-observer
    kubectl rollout restart deployment/rubixkube-observer -n rubixkube
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No insights showing despite pod failures">
### RubixKube takes 1-2 minutes to detect and analyze issues.
    If failures are immediate but no insights after 5 minutes:
    - Check observer agent is running
    - Verify namespace is being watched (default: all namespaces)
    - Check RubixKube dashboard for agent status
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
