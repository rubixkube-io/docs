# Talk to Your Infrastructure

The **Chat interface** lets you interact with your infrastructure using natural language - no kubectl commands needed. Ask questions like you would to a colleague, and the SRI Agent responds with actual data from your cluster.

<Info>
**What makes it special:** The SRI Agent understands context, remembers your conversation, and can execute queries across your entire infrastructure.

## Advanced Queries

### Troubleshooting Specific Issues

**Query:**
```
"Why is memory-hog-demo failing?"
```

**Detailed Response:**
```
Analysis of memory-hog-demo:

ROOT CAUSE: Out of Memory (OOMKilled)

Evidence:
- Memory limit: 50Mi
- Container attempted to allocate: ~100Mi
- Kubernetes killed container at 50Mi usage
- Pod has restarted 5 times in 3 minutes

Timeline:
01:58:00 - Pod started
01:58:05 - Memory usage reached 50Mi
01:58:05 - OOMKilled by kernel
01:58:10 - Kubernetes restarted container
01:58:15 - Memory usage reached 50Mi again
01:58:15 - OOMKilled again
[Pattern continues...]

Recommendation:
1. Increase memory limit to 150Mi (50% buffer)
2. Monitor actual usage with: kubectl top pod memory-hog-demo
3. Consider HPA if load varies
4. Check for memory leaks in application code

Would you like me to help you fix this?
```

## Conversation Context

The SRI Agent **remembers your conversation:**

**Example flow:**

```
You: "What pods are failing?"
Agent: "Found 3 failing pods: broken-image-demo, memory-hog-demo, crash-loop-demo"

You: "Tell me more about the memory one"
Agent: [Provides detailed OOMKilled analysis]

You: "How do I fix it?"
Agent: "I recommend increasing memory limit to 150Mi. Here's the kubectl command..."

You: "What if that doesn't work?"
Agent: "Monitor for memory leaks. If usage keeps growing, check application code..."
```

**No need to repeat context** - the agent tracks the conversation.

## Query Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific About Scope">
    **Good:**
    - "Show me pods in production namespace"
    - "What's failing in my cluster?"
    - "Memory usage for payment-service deployment"
    
    **Too Vague:**
    - "Everything"
    - "Problems"
    - "Fix it"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Natural Language">
    **You can say:**
    - "Which pods are unhealthy?"
    - "Show me pods that aren't working"
    - "What's broken right now?"
    
    **All mean the same thing** - SRI Agent understands intent
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ask Follow-Up Questions">
    **Build on previous queries:**
    - "Tell me more about that"
    - "Why is that happening?"
    - "How do I fix it?"
    - "What should I do next?"
    
    Agent maintains context throughout the conversation
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Request Specific Data">
    **Ask for what you need:**
    - "Show me logs for pod X"
    - "What's the YAML for deployment Y?"
    - "Give me the events for namespace Z"
    - "CPU usage for all pods"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

## File Upload Feature

Click the **üìé attachment button** to upload YAML files:

**Use cases:**
- **Validate manifests** before deploying
- **Analyze configuration** for issues
- **Get deployment suggestions**
- **Check security best practices**

**Example:**
```
[Upload deployment.yaml]

Agent: "Analyzed your deployment manifest:

‚úÖ Valid YAML syntax
‚úÖ Resource limits defined
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: No liveness probe configured
‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Running as root user
‚ùå Error: Image pull secret missing for private registry

Recommendations:
1. Add livenessProbe for health checks
2. Set securityContext.runAsNonRoot: true
3. Create imagePullSecret for registry access

Would you like me to generate a fixed version?"
```

‚Üí Overview of pods, nodes, recent incidents

"Any issues overnight?"
‚Üí Activity from last 8 hours

"Show me resource usage trends"
‚Üí CPU/memory over time

"All clear?"
‚Üí Confirmation or list of action items
```

### Workflow 2: Incident Investigation

```
Alert received - investigating:

"What just failed?"
‚Üí List of recent failures

"Why did payment-service crash?"
‚Üí RCA with root cause

"Show me the logs"
‚Üí Relevant log excerpts

"Has this happened before?"
‚Üí Memory Engine recall of similar incidents

"How was it fixed last time?"
‚Üí Historical resolution steps
```

### Workflow 3: Deployment Validation

```
Before deploying new version:

"What's the current state of checkout-service?"
‚Üí Current pods, replicas, resource usage

"Any recent issues with checkout-service?"
‚Üí Incident history check

[Upload new-deployment.yaml]
"Validate this deployment"
‚Üí Manifest analysis and suggestions

"What's the risk of deploying this?"
‚Üí Change impact assessment

"Okay, I'm deploying. Monitor it"

## Power User Tips

### 1. Reference Incidents by Name

```
"Analyze incident crash-loop-demo"
```

The agent knows all active incidents from the Insights page.

### 2. Ask for Comparisons

```
"Compare memory usage between dev and prod namespaces"
"Which deployment uses the most CPU?"
"Show me the difference between v1.2 and v1.3 configs"
```

### 3. Request Historical Data

```
"Have we seen OOMKilled errors before?"
"What incidents happened last week?"
"Show me the pattern of crashes over time"
```

The agent queries the Memory Engine for historical context.

### 4. Get Explanations

```
"Explain what CrashLoopBackOff means"
"Why does Kubernetes kill OOM pods?"
"What's the difference between limits and requests?"
```

Educational mode - perfect for learning.

## Sample Conversation

Here's a real conversation flow:

```
You: "Good morning! How's my cluster?"

SRI Agent: "Good morning! Your cluster is mostly healthy:
- System Health: 100%
- 12 pods running (9 healthy, 3 failing)
- 3 active insights requiring attention
- All agents operational

The 3 failures are in rubixkube-tutorials namespace:
1. ImagePullBackOff (medium)
2. OOMKilled (HIGH)
3. CrashLoop (medium)

Would you like me to explain any of these?"

You: "What's the OOMKilled issue?"

SRI Agent: "The OOMKilled incident is on pod 'memory-hog-demo':

Root Cause: Container exceeded memory limit
- Limit set: 50Mi
- Attempted to use: ~100Mi
- Result: Kubernetes killed it to protect the node
- Restarts: 5 times in 3 minutes

This is HIGH severity because:
- Indicates resource misconfiguration
- Could affect node stability if many pods OOMKill
- Causes service downtime

Fix: Increase memory limit to 150Mi
Command: kubectl set resources pod memory-hog-demo --limits=memory=150Mi

Shall I walk you through the fix?"

You: "Yes, how do I fix it?"

SRI Agent: "Here's the step-by-step fix:

1. Delete the current pod:
   kubectl delete pod memory-hog-demo -n rubixkube-tutorials

2. Create new pod with correct memory:
   [Shows corrected YAML]

3. Verify it's running:
   kubectl get pod memory-fixed-demo -n rubixkube-tutorials
   
4. Monitor memory usage:
   kubectl top pod memory-fixed-demo -n rubixkube-tutorials

Expected: Memory usage will be ~98Mi, well under the 150Mi limit.

I'll monitor this for you and alert if it fails again."
