# Talk to Your Infra: The Complete Guide

The **Chat interface** is your conversational gateway to infrastructure intelligence. Instead of remembering complex `kubectl` commands or navigating multiple dashboards, simply ask questions in natural language and get intelligent, context-aware responses.

<Info>
**This is a hands-on guide!** We'll walk through REAL conversations with the SRI Agent, showing you exactly what to type, what responses look like, and how to use Chat effectively for different scenarios.
</Info>

<Warning>
**Beta Release - Query Mode Active**

The Chat interface in RubixKube Beta excels at:

</Frame>

**What you see:**
- 💬 **Message box** - Where you type your questions
- 🤖 **SRI Agent** dropdown - Select which agent to talk to
- 📎 **Attachment button** - Upload YAML files
- 🚀 **Quick Actions** - Pre-built query categories

---

### Step 2: Type Your First Question

Let's ask a basic question. Type in the message box:

```
"What pods are failing in my cluster?"
```

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/chat/chat-query-01-typed.png"
    alt="Query typed in chat box"
  />
</Frame>

Press **Enter** or click the **Send** button (↑ arrow).

---

### Step 3: Watch the SRI Agent Think

The agent immediately starts working. You'll see:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/chat/chat-response-01-failing-pods.png"
    alt="SRI Agent thinking and analyzing"
  />
</Frame>

**What's happening:**
- 🧠 **"Thought: Identifying Failing Pods"** - Agent planning its approach
- 🔧 **"Function Call: fetch_kubernetes_graph_snapshot"** - Agent querying cluster
- ✅ **"Executed Function"** - Query completed

<Note>
**This is the AI at work!** You can see exactly what the agent is doing - complete transparency into its reasoning process.
</Note>

---

### Step 4: Receive Intelligent Response

The SRI Agent responds with context-aware analysis:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/chat/chat-response-02-complete.png"
    alt="Complete agent response"
  />
</Frame>

**Response includes:**
- ✅ What it found (or didn't find)
- ✅ Reasoning about the results
- ✅ Follow-up questions to help narrow the search
- ✅ Suggestions for next steps

**Example response:**
> "I've checked for pods and deployments in the `default` namespace and found nothing. This suggests one of the following:
> 
> - **There are no workloads deployed in the `default` namespace.** You might have deployed your applications in other namespaces.
> - **The cluster is new or empty.**
> 
> To investigate further, could you tell me:
> - Which namespace are your applications deployed in?"

<Tip>
**The agent asks clarifying questions!** It doesn't just fail - it guides you to provide the information it needs.
</Tip>

---

### Step 5: Have a Conversation

Chat remembers context. You can follow up naturally:

**You:** "Check the rubixkube-tutorials namespace"

**Agent:** "Of course, Connect. I'll check the `rubixkube-tutorials` namespace for you."

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/chat/chat-response-03-namespace-query.png"
    alt="Agent investigating specific namespace"
  />
</Frame>

**No need to repeat yourself** - the agent understands you're still talking about pods failing.

---

## Real Example: Investigating an OOMKilled Pod

Let's walk through a REAL troubleshooting session captured from the RubixKube console.

### Scenario: User Knows a Pod is Failing

**Query:** `"memory-hog-demo"`

Just typing the pod name is enough! The agent understands context from the previous conversation.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/chat/chat-full-conversation-oomkilled-analysis.png"
    alt="Complete OOMKilled investigation"
  />
</Frame>

### What the Agent Did (Automatically):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fetched Pod Status">
    **Function Called:** `fetch_kubernetes_graph_snapshot`
    
    **Found:**
    - Pod: `memory-hog-demo`
    - Status: `CrashLoopBackOff`
    - Restarts: 12 times
    - Labels: `scenario: oomkilled`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Retrieved Logs">
    **Function Called:** `fetch_kubernetes_logs`
    
    **Log Output:**
    ```
    dispatching hogs: 0 cpu, 0 io, 1 vm, 0 hdd
    ```
    
    Agent identified: **Memory consumption pattern** (1 vm = high memory usage)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analyzed Root Cause">
    **Agent Conclusion:**
    
    ### Root Cause
    The `memory-hog-demo` pod is configured to use more memory than the limit allows, causing Kubernetes to terminate it to protect the node's stability.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Provided Solutions">
    **Agent Recommendations:**
    
    ### Solution
    1. **Increase the Memory Limit:** If the application legitimately needs more memory, increase the limit in the deployment configuration.
    2. **Set a Memory Request:** Help Kubernetes schedule the pod on a node with enough memory.
    
    ### Recommendation
    For this demo pod, set a **reasonable memory limit and request** to prevent cluster impact.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**All of this happened automatically** in 28 seconds with 3 function calls. You just typed the pod name!
</Note>

## Real Power: Multi-Step Troubleshooting

Here's how Chat handles **complex, multi-part problems:**

### The Scenario

Pod `api-gateway` is responding slowly. Traditional debugging would involve:
1. Check pod status (kubectl)
2. Get logs (kubectl logs)
3. Check resource usage (kubectl top)
4. Check for network issues
5. Review recent changes
6. Google error messages
7. Try various fixes

**Time: 20-30 minutes**

### The Chat Way

**Single query:** `"Why is api-gateway slow?"`

**Agent automatically:**
1. ✅ Fetches pod status
2. ✅ Retrieves logs
3. ✅ Checks resource metrics
4. ✅ Reviews recent events
5. ✅ Analyzes network connectivity
6. ✅ Queries Memory Engine for similar issues
7. ✅ Provides root cause + fix

**Time: 1-2 minutes**

<Note>
**The agent does in parallel what would take you 10+ serial steps.**
</Note>

## Comparing Workflows

| Task | Traditional | With RubixKube Chat | Time Saved |
|------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| Find failing pods | `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces \| grep -v Running` | "Show me failing pods" | 90% |
| Investigate OOM | kubectl describe, logs, events, metrics | "Why did X OOMKill?" | 85% |
| Check cluster health | Multiple kubectl commands, dashboards | "What's my cluster health?" | 95% |
| Deployment validation | Manual YAML review, dry-run | Upload + "Validate this" | 80% |
| Learn Kubernetes concept | Google, docs, trial & error | "Explain X with examples from my cluster" | 70% |

**Average time saved: 84%**

---

## Integration with Other RubixKube Features

### Chat + Dashboard

**Workflow:**
1. See incident in Dashboard
2. Click "Provide to Chat Context"
3. Ask follow-up questions in Chat

**Example:**
- Dashboard shows "OOMKilled" incident
- Click "Provide to Chat Context"
- Chat auto-loads: "I see you're looking at incident OOMKilled on memory-hog-demo. What would you like to know?"

---

### Chat + Insights

**Workflow:**
1. View RCA report in Insights
2. Click "Discuss in Chat"
3. Ask detailed questions about the analysis

**Example queries:**
```
"Why did you conclude the root cause was memory?"
"What evidence supports this?"
"Has this pattern happened before?"
```

---

### Chat + Memory Engine

The agent automatically queries your incident history:

```
You: "We just had an OOMKilled incident"
Agent: "I found 3 similar OOMKilled incidents in the past:
        - incident-123 (resolved by increasing memory)
        - incident-456 (memory leak fixed in code)
        - incident-789 (namespace quota issue)
        
        Which approach fits your current situation?"
```

---

## Current Limitations (Beta)

<Warning>
**What Chat CANNOT do in Beta:**
- ❌ Execute kubectl commands automatically
- ❌ Apply configuration changes directly
- ❌ Create or modify resources
- ❌ Restart pods or deployments
- ❌ Access resources outside connected clusters

**What's Coming Q1 2026:**
- 🔜 Automated remediation with approval workflow
- 🔜 One-click fix application
- 🔜 Deployment generation from descriptions
- 🔜 Automated runbook creation

For now, **Chat is advisory** - it tells you WHAT to do and HOW, but you execute the commands.
</Warning>

---

## Feedback Buttons

After each response, you can rate it:

- 👍 **Good response** - Helps improve the agent
- 👎 **Bad response** - Flags for review
