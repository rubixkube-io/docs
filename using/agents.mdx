## Troubleshooting workflow
1. Filter to Inactive to find which agents are down.
2. Open the item and review capabilities or info to confirm expected behavior.
3. Check underlying Kubernetes pod logs for the agent.
4. Restart the pod if needed, then refresh the page and verify status changes to Active.
