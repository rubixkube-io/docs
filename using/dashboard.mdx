# Using the Dashboard: Complete Guide

The **Dashboard** is your central command center - providing real-time system health, active incidents, agent status, infrastructure overview, and live activity streams all in one view.

<Info>
**Based on real data:** This guide uses actual screenshots from a live RubixKube dashboard monitoring a Kubernetes cluster with 14 pods, including 3 failing pods that RubixKube detected and analyzed.
</Info>

## Dashboard Overview

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/using/DASHBOARD-01-main-view-loaded.png"
    alt="Complete dashboard view with all panels and real data"
  />
</Frame>

**The dashboard shows:**
- **4 Key Metrics** at the top (System Health, Active Insights, RCA Reports, Agents)
- **Infrastructure Panel** with cluster summary
- **Activity Feed** with real-time events
- **RCA Live Stream** showing analysis in progress

---

## The 4 Key Metrics Explained

### 1. System Health: 100%

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What It Means" icon="heart-pulse">
    Overall health of your infrastructure based on:
    - Pod health status
    - Resource utilization
    - Incident history
    - Agent connectivity
  </Card>

  <Card title="How It's Calculated" icon="calculator">
    - 100% = All pods healthy, no active incidents
    - 95-99% = Minor issues detected
    - 85-94% = Multiple incidents
    - Below 85% = Critical issues
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**When to worry:** Below 95% means you should investigate Active Insights.

---

### 2. Active Insights: 3

**What it shows:** Number of issues currently requiring your attention

**From our real dashboard:**
- "3" issues requiring attention
- Includes: ImagePullBackOff, CrashLoopBackOff, OOMKilled

**Types of insights:**
- üî¥ **HIGH severity** - OOMKilled, critical failures
- üü° **medium severity** - Pod crashes, image pull errors
- üü¢ **low severity** - Configuration warnings

**Click the number** to go directly to Insights page for full details.

---

### 3. Intelligent Analysis: 3 RCA Reports

**What it shows:** Number of Root Cause Analysis reports generated by the RCA Pipeline Agent

**From our dashboard:**
- 3 RCA reports completed
- Shows analysis is done, not just detection

**What this means:**
- RubixKube didn't just detect failures
- It ANALYZED them and found root causes
- Complete reports available with evidence

**Click to view** all RCA reports in Insights.

---

### 4. Agents: 3/4 Active

**What it shows:** How many AI agents are running / total agents

**From our dashboard:** "3/4 Active"
- 3 agents operational
- 1 agent offline or degraded

**The 4 agents:**
1. **RubixKube Observer** - Monitors cluster
2. **RCA Pipeline** - Analyzes incidents
3. **Memory Agent** - Stores learnings
4. **SRI Agent** - Powers Chat

**When not all active:** Click Agents in navigation to see which one is offline.

---

## Infrastructure Panel

<Frame>
  <img

## Understanding the Metrics

### System Health Calculation

**How RubixKube calculates the 100%:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pod Health Check">
    Running pods / Total pods = Base score
  </Step>

  <Step title="Incident Weight">
    HIGH severity: -5%
    
    medium severity: -2%
    
    low severity: -0.5%
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent Connectivity">
    All agents active: +0%
    
    1 agent down: -3%
  </Step>

  <Step title="Final Score">
    Weighted average = System Health %
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Our dashboard:** 100% because all core pods healthy despite tutorial namespace failures.

---

## Infrastructure Panel Deep Dive

**What each metric means:**

### Nodes: 1

**Our cluster:** Single-node KIND cluster

**In production:** Would show multiple nodes (e.g., "5 nodes")

**Click "View page"** to see node details, resource usage, taints/tolerations

---

### Pods: 14

**Our cluster breakdown:**
- 8 system pods (kube-system namespace)
- 3 RubixKube pods (rubixkube-system)
- 3 failing tutorial pods

**Colors:**

- üü° Yellow = Some issues
- üî¥ Red = Critical failures

---

### Deployments: 4

**Our cluster:**

---

## Activity Feed Explained

**From our dashboard - 7 events:**

1. Pod broken-image-demo pending (INSIGHT, medium)
2. crash-loop-demo crashes (INSIGHT, medium)
3. crash-loop-demo RCA complete (RCA)
4. memory-hog-demo crashes (INSIGHT, medium)
5. memory-hog-demo RCA complete (RCA)
6. **OOMKilled on memory-hog-demo (INSIGHT, HIGH)** ‚≠ê

## Best Practices for Dashboard Usage

<Accordion title="1. Start Every Day Here">
**Morning routine:**
1. Open Dashboard
2. 60-second scan
3. Note any changes from yesterday
4. Drill into issues as needed

**Benefit:** Early detection before customers notice
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Keep Dashboard Open">
**Pro tip:** Keep dashboard in a pinned browser tab

**Why:** 
- Real-time updates via SSE
- Activity Feed refreshes automatically
- Spot new incidents immediately

**Notification:** Browser can alert you to new high-severity events
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Learn Your Baseline">
**Track normal patterns:**
- What's your typical System Health? (should be 95-100%)
- Average Active Insights count? (0-2 for healthy clusters)
- Normal pod count?

**Benefit:** Anomalies stand out immediately
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Use Activity Feed as Audit Log">
**The feed is chronological:**
- See when issues started
- Track incident resolution
- Verify deployments and changes

**Export:** Can export activity feed for post-mortems
</Accordion>
