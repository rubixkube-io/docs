## Understanding the Metrics

### System Health Calculation

### How RubixKube calculates the 100%:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Pod Health Check">
    Running pods / Total pods = Base score
    
    In our cluster: Healthy system pods contribute to high score
  </Step>

  <Step title="Incident Weight">
** HIGH severity **: -5%
    
** medium severity **: -2%
    
** low severity **: -0.5%
    
    Our dashboard: 3 medium severity issues don't drop health below threshold
  </Step>

  <Step title="Agent Connectivity">
** All agents active **: +0%
    
** 1 agent down **: -3%
    
    Our dashboard: 3/4 agents active
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resource Health">
    Considers:
    - Node status (all nodes ready)
    - Critical system pods (kube-system namespace)
    - RubixKube components
  </Step>

  <Step title="Final Score">
    Weighted average = System Health %
    
    Our dashboard: 100% because core infrastructure is healthy
  </Step>
</Steps>

** Why 100% with 3 active insights?**- The failing pods are in tutorial namespace (non-critical)
- Core system pods are all healthy
- System infrastructure is operational
- Agents are mostly active (3/4)

---

## Infrastructure Panel Deep Dive

## Real Data from Our Dashboard

** What we captured:**-  System Health:** 100%**(all core systems healthy)
-  Active Insights:** 3 **(broken-image-demo, crash-loop-demo, memory-hog-demo)
-  Intelligent Analysis:** 3 RCA reports **(all analyzed with root causes)
-  Agents:** 3/4 active **(1 offline, 3 operational)
-  Infrastructure:** 1 node, 14 pods, 4 deployments, 3 services **-  Expanded:** 7 namespaces, 1 agent pod **-  Activity Feed:** 7 events **(4 INSIGHTS, 3 RCA reports)
-  RCA Stream:** LIVE ** with 0 active events

** This demonstrates:**- Dashboard provides complete visibility even when things are failing
- System distinguishes between critical vs non-critical failures
- RCA Pipeline automatically analyzes incidents
- Real-time monitoring with historical context

## Troubleshooting Dashboard Issues

### Dashboard not loading
** Symptoms:** Spinner stays visible, "Initializing dashboard..." message persists

** Causes:**- Backend API connection issue
- SSE connection failed
- Browser cache problem

** Solutions:** 1. Hard refresh: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify cluster connection in Settings
4. Check RubixKube backend pods are running

---

### Activity Feed shows "No recent activity" but issues exist
** Symptoms:** Feed is empty despite active insights

** Causes:**- SSE connection not established
- Events not being generated
- Time range filter active

** Solutions:** 1. Click "Refresh all data"
2. Check browser console for SSE errors
3. Verify RubixKube Observer is running
4. Check "Connect to SSE to see live events" message

---

### Metrics showing old data
** Symptoms:** Timestamp not updating, stale numbers

** Causes:**- Auto-refresh disabled
- API timeout
- Backend issue

** Solutions:** 1. Click "Refresh all data" manually
2. Check network tab for failed requests
3. Verify backend API health
4. Restart browser if needed

---

### Infrastructure shows "Disconnected"
** Symptoms:** Red status indicator, no metrics

** Causes:**- Cluster connection lost
- Kubeconfig invalid
- Network issue

** Solutions:** 1. Go to Settings → Clusters
2. Verify cluster connection status
3. Test connection
4. Re-add cluster if needed
5. Check kubeconfig validity

---

## Performance Tips

** For large clusters:**- Dashboard optimized for up to 1000 pods
- Activity Feed shows most recent 50 events
- Older events paginated
- Infrastructure panel uses aggregated counts

** For slow connections:**- Dashboard data compressed
- SSE uses efficient streaming
- Images lazy-loaded
- Metrics cached briefly

** For multiple clusters:**- Switch cluster in Settings
- Dashboard refreshes automatically
- Each cluster has independent metrics
- Activity Feed filtered by selected cluster
