# Using the Dashboard

The **Dashboard** is your central command center in RubixKube - providing at-a-glance system health, active incidents, agent status, and real-time activity feeds.

<Info>
**What you'll learn:** How to interpret each dashboard panel, what the metrics mean, and how to use the dashboard for daily monitoring.

  <Card title="Key Metrics" icon="gauge-high">
    System Health, Active Insights, Intelligent Analysis, Agents
  </Card>
  <Card title="Infrastructure Panel" icon="server">
    Connected clusters, nodes, pods, deployments, services
  </Card>
  <Card title="Activity Feed" icon="list">
    Recent incidents, insights, and system events
  </Card>
  <Card title="RCA Live Stream" icon="chart-network">
    Real-time root cause analysis in progress
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Key Metrics Explained

### System Health

**What it shows:** Overall infrastructure health percentage

**Calculation:**
- 100% = All pods healthy, no incidents
- 90-99% = Minor issues detected
- 75-89% = Active incidents requiring attention
- Below 75% = Multiple critical issues

**When to worry:** Below 90% means you should check Active Insights.

---

### Active Insights

**What it shows:** Number of issues currently requiring attention

**Examples:**
- Pod failures (CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff)
- Resource issues (OOMKilled)
- Configuration problems
- Deployment failures

**Action:** Click the number to go to Insights page for details.

---

### Intelligent Analysis

**What it shows:** Number of RCA reports generated

**What it means:**
- RubixKube's RCA Pipeline Agent has analyzed incidents
- Complete root cause reports available
- Evidence and timelines documented

**Action:** Click to view RCA reports in Insights.

---

### Agents

**What it shows:** Active agents / Total agents

**Example:** "3/4 Active" means:
- 3 agents running normally
- 1 agent offline or degraded

**Action:** Click to go to Agents page for health details.

---

## Infrastructure Panel

Shows your connected cluster summary:

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Nodes** | Physical/virtual machines in cluster |
| **Pods** | Running application containers |
| **Deployments** | Managed application sets |
| **Services** | Network endpoints |

**Status Indicator:**
- üü¢ **Connected** - Healthy cluster connection
- üü° **Degraded** - Partial connectivity
- üî¥ **Disconnected** - No connection to cluster

**Click "View page"** to see full Infrastructure topology.

---

## Activity Feed

Real-time stream of events and insights:

### Event Types

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Incidents">
    üî¥ **Critical failures detected**
    
    Example: "Out of memory (OOMKilled) detected on Pod/memory-hog-demo"
    
    - Shows severity (HIGH, medium, low)
    - Status (active, resolved)
    - Time detected
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Insights">
    üìä **AI analysis generated**
    
    Example: "Container experiencing repeated crashes in crash-loop-demo"
    
    - Shows restart count
    - Identifies patterns
    - Links to RCA if available
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Resolutions">
    ‚úÖ **Issues fixed**
    
    Example: "Incident resolved: ImagePullBackOff on broken-image-demo"
    
    - Shows resolution time
    - Links to what was fixed
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Configuration Changes">
    üìù **Cluster updates**
    
    Example: "Deployment scaled: api-gateway 3‚Üí5 replicas"
    
    - Tracks deployments
    - Shows scaling events
    - Records config changes
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**The feed updates in real-time** - no refresh needed!

---

## RCA Live Stream

Shows the RCA Pipeline Agent working in real-time:

**What you'll see:**
- Function calls being executed
- Evidence being gathered
- Pattern matching in progress
- Analysis completion percentage

**Statuses:**
- **RCA_IN_PROGRESS** - Currently analyzing (shows %)
- **RCA_COMPLETE** - Analysis finished, report available
- **RCA_FAILED** - Analysis couldn't complete

**Click on any item** to see full RCA report.

## Daily Dashboard Workflow

### Morning Check (30 seconds)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check System Health">
    100%? All clear. Below 100%? Investigate.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Active Insights">
    0? Perfect. 1+? Check what needs attention.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify All Agents Active">
    Should show "3/3" or "4/4" depending on configuration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Scan Activity Feed">
    Any new incidents overnight? Any resolutions?
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** Confident understanding of cluster state in under 1 minute.

---

## Understanding Dashboard Updates

**Refresh frequency:**
- **Metrics:** Every 30 seconds
- **Activity Feed:** Real-time (SSE)
- **Infrastructure:** Every 60 seconds
- **RCA Stream:** Real-time

**Manual refresh:** Click the refresh button in any panel

## Common Dashboard Scenarios

### Scenario 1: System Health Drops

**What you see:** System Health: 85%

**What to do:**
1. Check **Active Insights** number
2. Scroll to **Activity Feed**
3. Identify recent incidents (marked üî¥)
4. Click incident for details

---

### Scenario 2: Active Insights Increases

**What you see:** Active Insights: 3 (was 0)

**What to do:**
1. Note the number jumped
2. Check **Activity Feed** for what was detected
3. Click **Insights** in navigation for full details
4. Prioritize by severity (HIGH first)

---

### Scenario 3: Agent Goes Offline

**What you see:** Agents: 2/3 Active

**What to do:**
1. Click "Agents" number or navigate to Agents page
2. Identify which agent is offline
3. Check agent logs
4. May need to restart agent pod

---

## Dashboard Best Practices

<Accordion title="Use as Daily Starting Point">
**Every morning:**
1. Open Dashboard
2. 30-second scan
3. Identify any issues
4. Drill into details as needed

**Benefit:** Early detection before issues escalate
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Keep Dashboard Open in a Tab">
**Why:** Real-time updates alert you to new incidents

**Pro tip:** Use browser notifications for activity feed updates
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Understand Your Baseline">
**Learn what's normal for YOUR cluster:**
- Typical System Health %
- Average Active Insights count
- Normal activity feed volume

**Benefit:** Spot anomalies faster
</Accordion>
