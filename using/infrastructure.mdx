# Using Infrastructure Topology

The Infrastructure page provides an interactive, end-to-end map of your Kubernetes cluster. Use it to understand relationships between resources, assess health, and drill into details using multiple view modes.

## Header and Global Controls

<Frame>

    src="/images/using/using-infrastructure-01-header.png"
    alt="Infrastructure header with title and refresh"
  />
  <Caption>Header with title, description, and Refresh action</Caption>
</Frame>

-** Title and description **: Confirms you are in Infrastructure Topology.
-** Refresh **: Re-fetches topology and metrics. Use after deployments or scaling events.

## Metrics Summary

    alt="Summary metrics: total resources, namespaces, healthy"
  />
  <Caption>Summary metrics sourced live from the cluster</Caption>
</Frame>

-** Total Resources **: Count of all resources indexed in the current cluster view.
-** Namespaces **: Distinct namespaces represented in the current data set.
-** Healthy Resources **: Resources reporting healthy state.

## Controls: Search, Views, Layout

    alt="Search, view mode buttons, and layout selector"
  />
  <Caption>Controls: search, view mode selector, and graph layout selector</Caption>
</Frame>

-** Search resources...**: Type names, kinds, or namespaces to filter results instantly.
-** View modes **: Graph, Flow, Table, Tree, Dashboard, Namespace, Dependencies.
-** Layout selector **(Graph view): Hierarchical, Force, Circular, Tree, Grid.
-** Clear all **: Removes active filters and resets controls.

Active filters reflect your selections in real time:

## Graph View

Graph view renders resources as nodes with relationships as edges. Use it to reason about dependencies and blast radius.

    alt="Graph view - hierarchical layout"
  />
  <Caption>Graph view using the Hierarchical layout</Caption>

### Graph Settings

Open Graph settings to tune readability and performance for large graphs.

    alt="Graph settings dialog"

  <Caption>Graph View Settings: elasticity, labels, health status, and layout strengths</Caption>
</Frame>

### Layouts

Switch layouts to highlight different structural perspectives.

    alt="Graph view - force layout"
  />
  <Caption>Graph view using the Force layout</Caption>

## Table View

Table view provides a sortable, scannable inventory with per-row actions.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/using/using-infrastructure-05-table.png"
    alt="Resource table with 26 resources"
  />
  <Caption>Resource Table with Name, Type, Namespace, Status, and Actions</Caption>
</Frame>

### Searching and Filtering

Use the search input to narrow to a namespace, type, or resource name.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/using/using-infrastructure-08-search-kube-system.png"
    alt="Search filtered to kube-system"
  />
  <Caption>Search narrowed to the kube-system namespace</Caption>
</Frame>

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/using/using-infrastructure-09-table-filtered-kube-system.png"
    alt="Table filtered to kube-system"
  />
  <Caption>Filtered table showing only kube-system and rubixkube-system resources</Caption>
</Frame>

## Resource Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Node | Kubernetes worker/control-plane node | kind-control-plane |
| Pod | Smallest deployable unit, containers grouped | coredns-66bc... |
| Deployment | Declarative set of Pods with rollout strategy | rubixkube-observer |
| ReplicaSet | Maintains a stable set of replica Pods | ...-59f488b9df |
| Service | Stable virtual IP exposing a set of Pods | kube-dns |

## Common Workflows

### Investigate a service outage
1. Go to Graph view and select the Service.
2. Inspect connected Pods for degraded or failing status.
3. Switch to Table view and filter by the service's namespace to see related Deployments, ReplicaSets, and Pods.

### Validate a deployment
1. After a rollout, click Refresh.
2. In Table view, sort by Type and verify Deployment, ReplicaSet, and new Pods.
3. In Graph view, confirm edges from Service to the new Pods.

### Namespace health review
1. Filter by the target namespace.
2. Check Summary metrics and Table status column.
3. Use Graph settings to enable labels and health for quick scanning.

## Tips

- Prefer Hierarchical layout for large clusters; switch to Force for cluster adjacency insights.
- Hide labels for very dense graphs to improve render performance, then toggle them on when zoomed in.
- Use Clear all to quickly reset complex filter states.
