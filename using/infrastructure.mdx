- By namespace
- By status (Running, Pending, Failed)

**Quick actions:**
- Click "View" on any resource for details
- Filter to show only unhealthy resources

1. Click Table view
2. Sort by Status
3. Look for CrashLoopBackOff, ImagePullBackOff

### Understand Dependencies
1. Click Graph view
2. Select a service
3. See all connected pods

### Namespace Overview
1. Filter by namespace (e.g., production)
2. See all resources in that namespace
