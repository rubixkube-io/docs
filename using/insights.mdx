# Using Insights & RCA

The **Insights** page is where RubixKube's intelligence shines - showing you not just WHAT failed, but WHY it failed, with complete root cause analysis, evidence, and remediation suggestions.

<Info>
**What you'll learn:** How to interpret incident groups, read RCA reports, understand severity levels, navigate timelines, and use evidence for troubleshooting.
</Info>

## Insights Overview

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/using/using-insights-01-overview.png"
    alt="Insights page showing incident groups and RCA reports"
  />
</Frame>

**The page shows:**
- **Incident Groups** - Similar incidents grouped together
- **RCA Status** - Analysis progress for each incident
- **Severity Levels** - HIGH, medium, low priority
- **Evidence Links** - Logs, events, metrics

---

## Understanding Incident Groups

RubixKube groups related incidents together for easier management.

### Example: OOMKilled Incident Group

**What you see:**
- **Title:** "OOMKilled in Pod/memory-hog-demo"
- **Severity:** HIGH (red indicator)
- **Items:** 2 items (multiple occurrences)
- **RCA Badge:** Shows analysis is complete

**Why grouped:** Same root cause affecting same resource multiple times.

---

## Severity Levels Explained

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="ðŸ”´ HIGH" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Critical issues:**
    - OOMKilled (memory exhaustion)
    - CrashLoopBackOff with high restart count
    - Service unavailability
    
    **Action:** Immediate attention required
  </Card>

  <Card title="ðŸŸ¡ Medium" icon="circle-exclamation">
    **Important but not critical:**
    - ImagePullBackOff
    - Single pod crashes
    - Resource warnings
    
    **Action:** Address within hours
  </Card>

  <Card title="ðŸŸ¢ Low" icon="circle-info">
    **Informational:**
    - Configuration drift
    - Best practice violations
    - Optimization opportunities
    
    **Action:** Review when convenient

## Real Example: OOMKilled RCA

From our actual cluster:

### Root Cause

> "The memory-hog-demo pod is configured to use more memory than the limit allows, causing Kubernetes to terminate it to protect the node's stability."

### Contributing Factors

1. Memory limit set to 50Mi
2. Application attempted to allocate ~100Mi
3. Kubernetes killed container to protect node

### Recommended Actions

1. **Increase Memory Limit** (High Priority)
   - Suggested: 150Mi (50% buffer over observed usage)
   - Owner: Application Team
   
2. **Monitor for Memory Leaks** (Medium Priority)
   - Check if usage grows over time
   - Owner: Application Team

3. **Implement Resource Quotas** (Low Priority)
   - Prevent namespace over-allocation
   - Owner: Platform Engineering

**Each recommendation is actionable** with specific numbers and ownership.

## RCA Confidence Levels

Each RCA report shows a confidence percentage:

| Confidence | Meaning | What to Do |
|------------|---------|------------|
| **90-100%** | High confidence in diagnosis | Trust and implement recommendations |
| **70-89%** | Good confidence | Review evidence, likely correct |
| **50-69%** | Moderate confidence | Verify with logs before acting |
| **Below 50%** | Low confidence | Manual investigation needed |

**Our OOMKilled example:** 90%+ confidence âœ…

## Incident Lifecycle

### 1. Detection

**What happens:**
- Observer Agent detects failure
- Insight created instantly
- Appears in Activity Feed

**Time:** Usually within 60 seconds

---

### 2. RCA Analysis

**What happens:**
- RCA Pipeline Agent investigates
- Gathers logs, events, metrics
- Correlates with historical patterns

**Status:** "RCA_IN_PROGRESS" (you'll see % completion)

**Time:** 30-90 seconds depending on complexity

---

### 3. Report Generated

**What happens:**
- RCA complete
- Root cause identified
- Recommendations provided

**Status:** "RCA_COMPLETE"

**Badge:** "RCA" appears on incident

---

### 4. Remediation

**What happens:**
- You review recommendations
- Apply fixes manually (Beta)
- Monitor for resolution

**Future:** Auto-remediation with approval

---

### 5. Resolution

**What happens:**
- RubixKube detects issue fixed
- Incident marked resolved
- Added to Memory Engine for learning

**Status:** "Resolved"

---

## Using Evidence for Troubleshooting

Click "Evidence" tab in any RCA report:

### What You Get

**Pod Events:**
```
Normal  Scheduled  2m ago    Successfully assigned
Warning Failed     1m ago    OOMKilled
Normal  Pulling    1m ago    Pulling image
Warning BackOff    30s ago   Back-off restarting
```

**Log Excerpts:**
```
dispatching hogs: 0 cpu, 0 io, 1 vm, 0 hdd
stress: FAIL: [1] (452) hogvm failed
```

**Metrics:**
- Memory usage over time
- CPU utilization
- Restart count graph

**This is YOUR data** - RubixKube shows exactly what it found.

### From Insights â†’ Chat

**Click "Add to Chat Context"**

Then ask Chat:
```
"Explain this OOMKilled incident"
"How do I fix it?"
"Has this happened before?"
```

Chat has full RCA context!

---

### From Insights â†’ Dashboard

Click incident â†’ See it highlighted in Dashboard Activity Feed

**Use case:** Verify incident is same one you saw in dashboard.

---

### From Insights â†’ Memory Engine

RubixKube automatically stores:
- Root cause patterns
- Resolution steps that worked
- Time to resolve

**Benefit:** Faster resolution next time.
