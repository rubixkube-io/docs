    alt="Insights page header with health metrics"
  />
</Frame>

**The header shows:**
- **Title**: "Unified Insights" with description
- **Health Metrics**:
  - **Health**: 75% RCA coverage
  - **Total Groups**: 4 incident groups
  - **Critical Issues**: 0 (no critical incidents)
  - **High Priority**: 1 (one high-severity issue)
- **Refresh data** button for manual updates

---

## Understanding Health Metrics

### Health: 75% RCA Coverage

**What it means:**
- 75% of detected incidents have completed RCA analysis
- Higher percentage = better analysis coverage
- Target: 90%+ for optimal observability

**Why it matters:**
- Shows how effectively RubixKube is analyzing your incidents
- Low coverage may indicate agent issues or complex incidents
- Tracks the intelligence level of your monitoring

---

### Total Groups: 4

**What it means:**
- 4 incident groups currently tracked
- Groups cluster related incidents together
- Each group may contain multiple occurrences

**From our dashboard:**
1. CrashLoop in Pod/crash-loop-demo (2 items)
2. OOMKilled in Pod/memory-hog-demo (2 items)
3. CrashLoop in Pod/memory-hog-demo (2 items)
4. PodPending in Pod/broken-image-demo (1 item)

---

### Critical Issues: 0

**What it means:**
- No critical-severity incidents active
- Critical = system-wide failures, data loss risk
- This is your most important metric

**When you see this:**
- 0 = Excellent, no urgent action needed
- 1+ = Immediate response required

---

### High Priority: 1

**What it means:**
- 1 high-severity incident requiring attention
- High = significant impact, needs prompt resolution
- Less urgent than critical, more than medium

**From our dashboard:**
- OOMKilled in Pod/memory-hog-demo (HIGH severity)

- Clickable to view in Infrastructure

---

#### SUGGESTIONS

**Quick remediation steps** before full RCA:

1. Check container logs for error messages
2. Verify application configuration
3. Consider increasing resource limits
4. Check for external dependencies that might be unavailable

**These are generic** - full RCA provides specific root cause.

---

#### SOURCE EVENTS

**Original detection event:**
- **Type**: CrashLoop
- **Pod**: crash-loop-demo
- **Details**: "CrashLoopBackOff: container app in pod crash-loop-demo restarted 3 times"
- **Namespace**: rubixkube-tutorials

---

#### PROVIDE TO CHAT CONTEXT

**Button at bottom** - sends entire incident context to Chat interface for AI-powered investigation.

## RCA Analysis Tab

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/using/using-insights-05-rca-analysis.png"
    alt="RCA Analysis tab showing root cause, factors, and impact"
  />
</Frame>

**Click "RCA Analysis" tab** to see complete analysis.

### Analysis Status

**ANALYSIS COMPLETE**
- Green checkmark icon
- Status: Pending Resolution
- **Confidence: 40%** with progress bar

**Lower confidence** means more uncertainty - cross-reference with evidence.

---

### ROOT CAUSE

**From our real RCA:**

> "The application within the 'crash-loop-demo' pod was exiting immediately upon startup, leading Kubernetes to enter a 'CrashLoopBackOff' cycle. The precise reason for the application failure (e.g., code bug, configuration error, resource issue) could not be determined because the diagnostic tools for retrieving pod logs and events were not operational."

**What this tells you:**
- **Primary issue**: Application exits immediately on startup
- **Kubernetes response**: CrashLoopBackOff protection mechanism
- **Limitation**: Diagnostic tools unavailable, preventing deeper analysis
- **Possible causes**: Code bug, config error, or resource constraint

**Orange left border** highlights this as the key finding.

---

### CONTRIBUTING FACTORS

**Warning triangle icon** indicates factors that enabled or worsened the issue:

1. **Inability to retrieve specific error details** due to the failure of the 'get_pod_logs' and 'get_pod_events' diagnostic tools.

2. **A likely unhandled exception, misconfiguration, or resource constraint** within the containerized application, which are common causes for this behavior according to the general search query.

**These explain WHY** the root cause occurred or why analysis was limited.

---

### IMPACT ASSESSMENT

**Paragraph format explaining business impact:**

> "The 'crash-loop-demo' pod in the 'rubixkube-tutorials' namespace was unavailable due to repeated crashes. This caused a complete service outage for any functionality relying on this pod. The impact was contained to this specific application."

**Key information:**
- **Scope**: Single pod, single namespace
- **Severity**: Complete service outage for this pod
- **Containment**: No spread to other services
- **Risk**: Low (tutorial namespace, not production)

**AFFECTED SERVICES** subsection:
- **Pod/crash-loop-demo** (clickable resource link)

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New OOMKilled Incident

**What you see:**
- HIGH severity badge
- "OOMKilled in Pod/memory-hog-demo"
- RCA badge present

**What to do:**

1. Click incident to expand
2. Go to RCA Analysis tab
3. Read Root Cause (memory limit too low)
4. Check Recommended Actions
5. Click "Ask AI How" on "Increase memory limit" action
6. Implement suggested limit (e.g., increase from 50Mi to 150Mi)
7. Click "Apply" when done
8. Monitor for resolution

**Expected outcome**: Pod stops crashing, incident auto-resolves.

---

### Scenario 2: Low RCA Confidence

**What you see:**
- Incident with 40% confidence
- "Status: RCA_GENERATED" but low certainty

**What to do:**

1. Click Evidence tab
2. Check Investigation Completeness (30%)
3. See which tools failed (e.g., get_pod_logs)
4. Perform manual investigation:
   ```
   kubectl logs crash-loop-demo -n rubixkube-tutorials
   kubectl describe pod crash-loop-demo -n rubixkube-tutorials
   ```
5. Click "Ask AI" with manual findings
6. Chat combines RCA + your data for better diagnosis

**Key lesson**: Low confidence doesn't mean wrong, just uncertain.

---

### Scenario 3: Incident Without RCA

**What you see:**
- "PodPending in Pod/broken-image-demo"
- No RCA badge
- Only shows Suggestions (not full RCA)

**Why this happens:**
- RCA not complete yet (check Timeline)
- RCA failed (check Timeline for errors)
- Incident type doesn't trigger RCA
- RCA Pipeline agent offline

**What to do:**

1. Check Timeline tab for RCA status
2. If "QUEUED_FOR_RCA" but no progress:
   - RCA Pipeline may be stuck
   - Go to Agents page, check RCA Pipeline Agent
3. If no RCA triggered:
   - Use Suggestions section for generic fixes
   - Click "Ask AI" for Chat investigation
4. Manual investigation:
   ```
   kubectl describe pod broken-image-demo -n rubixkube-tutorials
   ```
   Look for ImagePullBackOff errors

---

### Scenario 4: Multiple Related Incidents

**What you see:**
- "CrashLoop in Pod/memory-hog-demo" (MEDIUM)
- "OOMKilled in Pod/memory-hog-demo" (HIGH)
- Same pod, different incident types

**What this means:**
- Pod crashed due to OOM
- OOM is root cause
- CrashLoop is symptom

**What to do:**

1. Open HIGH severity incident first (OOMKilled)
2. Read RCA (memory limit too low)
3. Fix memory limit
4. Both incidents should resolve together
5. Mark both as related in notes

**Pro tip**: RubixKube groups related incidents when possible.

---

2. Check RCA Pipeline Agent status
3. If degraded, restart:
   ```
   kubectl rollout restart deployment/rca-pipeline -n rubixkube-system
   ```
4. Check Timeline tab for error messages
5. Verify cluster has resources for RCA workload

### Low RCA coverage (below 60%)

**Symptoms**: "Health: 55% RCA coverage" in header

**Causes:**
- Many incidents without RCA
- RCA failures
- Complex incidents taking longer

**Solutions:**

1. Filter by Status: Active, no RCA badge
2. Check those incidents' Timeline tabs for RCA failures
3. Verify diagnostic tools working (get_pod_logs, get_pod_events)
4. Check RCA Pipeline Agent logs:
   ```
   kubectl logs -l app=rca-pipeline -n rubixkube-system --tail=100
   ```
5. May need to tune RCA timeout settings in Settings

---

### Evidence completeness always low

**Symptoms**: Investigation Completeness consistently 30-40%

**Causes:**
- Diagnostic tools failing
- Permission issues
- Missing integrations

**Solutions:**

1. Check which tools are failing (Evidence tab shows source)
2. Verify RubixKube has proper RBAC permissions:
   ```
   kubectl auth can-i get pods --as=system:serviceaccount:rubixkube-system:rubixkube-observer
   kubectl auth can-i get events --as=system:serviceaccount:rubixkube-system:rubixkube-observer
   ```
3. Check integration connections in Settings → Integrations
4. Review RubixKube Observer Agent logs for errors
